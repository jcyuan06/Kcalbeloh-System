        // ******************************** Planet descriptions ********************************
        #LOC_KS_Anehta_description = Anehta is a gas giant planet that boasts a stunning planetary ring system. The planet is characterized by its perpetual cloud cover, which is divided into distinct lighter-hued zones and darker belts. Due to the conflicting circulation patterns of these zones and belts, the planet experiences violent storms and turbulence.
        #LOC_KS_Ahtpan_description = Ahtpan is a rocky desert planet with oceans primarily composed of naphtha. While it may seem like a good idea to construct a petrochemical plant on the planet's surface, the Kerbal Space Center (KSC) advises all kerbonauts to keep their helmets on while exploring the planet. This is because the planet's atmosphere emits a strong odor of mothballs!
        #LOC_KS_Anneheg_description = Anneheg is a planet with a dark, coal-like appearance that closely orbits around Aralc-A. Due to its proximity to the star, the intense heat and light have caused much of its surface to melt, resulting in the formation of lava rivers and oceans, as well as frequent vaporized metal storms. With its inhospitable conditions, Anneheg is regarded as one of the most hellish planets ever discovered.
        #LOC_KS_AralcA_description = Aralc-A is the first star of the binary system in Kcalbeloh system and is considered to be the brightest and most massive star in the system. Its high temperature and blue-white color suggest that it is an A-type main-sequence star.
        #LOC_KS_AralcB_description = Aralc-B, the second star in the binary system, is a small, low-mass star classified as an M-type main sequence star, also known as a red dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_AralcSystem_description = This is the barycenter of the binary star system.
        #LOC_KS_Arorua_description = Arorua is a large rocky planet tidally locked by Aralc-B. As a result of the strong solar winds emanating from Aralc-B, aurora can be observed from the entire hemisphere facing Aralc-B. At the same time, its atmosphere is gradually blowing away by the solar wind from the red dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_Dipuc_description = Dipuc is the only moon of Sera and its surface is marked by large craters, indicating that it has absorbed many severe meteorite impacts that would have otherwise struck Sera. The moon is also geologically active, featuring a significant number of active volcanoes on its surface as well as massive mountains that are visible even when near Sera.
        #LOC_KS_Efil_description = Efil appears like a sapphire nestled close to Anehta when viewed from a distance. Its charming atmosphere and beautiful beaches make it seem like an ideal vacation spot. Perhaps in the future, the Kerbal Space Center (KSC) will build a resort there. However, the question remains as to who could afford the ticket to visit this distant planet.
        #LOC_KS_Elad_description = Elad is the largest moon of Anehta and was the first of Anehta's moons to be discovered. It is believed that Elad had an atmosphere in the past and even supported liquid water on its surface, but it remains a mystery as to why the moon lost these characteristics over time.
        #LOC_KS_Enots_description = Enots is a small asteroid moon that is embedded within Anehta's ring system, and it is considered to be the smallest known moon of Anehta.
        #LOC_KS_Eulb_description = Eulb is … a blue moon.
        #LOC_KS_Iomena_description = Iomena is a rocky planet featuring large craters and oceans. Scientific research has indicated that the likelihood of life existing on this planet is exceedingly slim due to the high concentrations of ammonia present in both the atmosphere and oceans. Nonetheless, scientists have not abandoned the possibility of discovering life in such extreme environments.
        #LOC_KS_Kcalbeloh_description = Kcalbeloh is a supermassive black hole, and is the center of Kcalbeloh system. It doesn't have a jet or a superheated blue accretion disk, indicating it has probably not devoured a star in millions of years.
        #LOC_KS_Maelg_description = Maelg is the least massive and coolest star within the Kcalbeloh system, and consequently, it emits significantly less light than other stars. It is classified as an L-type brown dwarf.
        #LOC_KS_Mehtna_description = Mehtna is a frigid planet that is tidally locked to Maelg. The majority of its surface is covered by thick ice caps, except for the region near the sub-stellar point, which has been dubbed the "Warm Pole." Because of the planet's low atmospheric pressure, water boils well below room temperature, resulting in water existing primarily in the form of ice or water vapor.
        #LOC_KS_Meiuqer_description = Meiuqer is a small planet with an exceptionally eccentric orbit. Its surface temperature experiences significant fluctuations depending on its distance from Maelg.
        #LOC_KS_Noi_description = Noi is a Trojan asteroid that librates around the L4 Lagrange Point between Sunorc and the Simeht-Simetra System, which exists 60° ahead of the binary planets' barycenter in their orbit.
        #LOC_KS_Noira_description = Noira is the moon orbiting closest to the barycenter of the Simetra-Simeht binary planet system, and it is unique in the Kcalbeloh system for having a retrograde orbit. Its surface features a giant crater, suggesting it has experienced a significant impact from a relatively large celestial body in the past.
        #LOC_KS_Norihc_description = Norihc is a frigid moon that orbits the barycenter of the binary gas giants. Despite its icy exterior, it is geologically active and displays numerous deep fissures on its thick ice caps.
        #LOC_KS_Noyreg_description = Noyreg is a rocky moon with an extremely dense atmosphere, which obscures its surface beneath thick cloud layers. Its atmosphere has a mesmerizing green hue, but landing on this moon is considered extremely perilous due to the high concentrations of corrosive and toxic components in the air.
        #LOC_KS_Onrefni_description = Onrefni, a dwarf planet, orbits in extremely close proximity to Kcalbeloh, experiencing strong tidal forces that have torn its surface apart.
        #LOC_KS_Rouqea_description = Rouqea is a fascinating ocean world, completely covered in water. Unlike Laythe, its ocean is unique and distinct, with immense depths that could produce a mantle made of exotic ice due to the extreme pressure. Its mysterious and alluring depths continue to captivate the attention of researchers and scientists.
        #LOC_KS_Sedah_description = Sedah is a hot gas giant that orbits very closely to Sunorc. Its high atmospheric temperatures give it a slight glow. Despite being similar in size to Jool, it is only about one-seventh the mass of Jool, resulting in a less dense and more "fluffy" atmosphere.
        #LOC_KS_Sera_description = Sera is a barren, rocky planet with a striking ring system and several large lakes. Unfortunately, the lakes are toxic, and there is no known evidence of life on Sera.
        #LOC_KS_Simeht_description = Simeht, the smaller planet in the binary gas giant system, is also classified as an ice giant. However, unlike Simetra, its cloud bands and storms are difficult to observe in visible light.
        #LOC_KS_SimeSystem_description = This is the barycenter of the binary gas-giant system.
        #LOC_KS_Simetra_description = Simetra is the larger ice giant in the Simetra-Simeht binary gas giant system. Its blue appearance is attributed to the traces of methane found in its outermost regions, while other regions of the planet are believed to be colored green and yellow due to unknown compounds.
        #LOC_KS_Suluco_description = Suluco is a Kerbin-like planet that is tidally locked to Sunorc, meaning that one side of the planet always faces the star while the other side is in perpetual darkness. It is a bifurcated world, with a stark contrast between the two hemispheres. One side experiences an endless day while the other is shrouded in eternal night. The boundary between the two halves is a narrow ring of twilit eternity, which is the only region on the planet that could potentially support life.
        #LOC_KS_Sunorc_description = Sunorc is a K-type main sequence star, also known as an orange dwarf. It is smaller and cooler than Kerbol, making it of particular interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. Sunorc has a longer lifespan and emits less UV radiation, which increases the likelihood of habitable planets in its system.
        #LOC_KS_Tot_description = An asteroid moon orbiting around Suluco.
        #LOC_KS_Uleg_description = Uleg is a frigid planet with an orbit that takes it far from Kcalbeloh. Its surface is predominantly covered in ice. Its highly inclined and eccentric orbit suggests that it was likely captured by Kcalbeloh.

        #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Arorua = This planet.. seems to shimmer and glow in amazing patterns. We need more pictures.
        #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ahtpan = Hmm, looks yellow like Kerbol. Doesn't seem as warm though, Bob says we should try to ignite it and see what happens.
        #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Anehta = Stunning! This one has huge bands both around it and in it! Wonder how it looks from the ground?
        #autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Enots = This one's strange... It's small like an asteroid, but it's shape is like some kind of eccentric artpiece.

        // Kcalbeloh
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow1 = Approaching Kcalbeloh at low orbit feels like being pulled into a bottomless pit, with the intense gravitational pull making it difficult to keep our bearings and maintain control of the spacecraft.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow2 = Lander 1, prepare to detach, on my mark.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = The intense gravitational forces made our instruments go haywire, and we had to quickly retreat to a safer distance.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = Temperature readings in the vicinity of Kcalbeloh are extremely high, indicating intense radiation from its accretion disk.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Kcalbeloh_SrfLanded = My god, it's full of Krakens.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = The crew member reported feeling weightless and awe-struck while performing the EVA near Kcalbeloh. The intense gravitational pull was palpable even from a safe distance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = The crew report during an EVA near Kcalbeloh reveals a breathtaking view of the supermassive black hole's yellow accretion disk.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = A Mystery Goo experiment is not possible here, as the intense gravitational forces would likely disrupt any attempts to conduct an experiment in close proximity.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = The results of the gravity scan indicate a significant gravitational distortion, which could potentially aid future gravitational slingshot maneuvers around this massive celestial body.
            //#LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = The gravity scan of Kcalbeloh from a far away distance indicats the presence of large mass concentrations in the vicinity of the black hole.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = A gravity scan of Kcalbeloh from far away reveals tiny irregularities in the data. These are most likely planets, or 'blanets', orbiting the black hole. Some of these would have to be pretty close!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = The intense radiation from particles in the accretion disk shorted the instrument before we could take a reading.

        // Onrefni
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = It is truly disconcerting to think that the light illuminating your view of this… unfortunate little planet is not from a star, but from material and gas sped up so fast by the looming Kcalbeloh’s gargantuan gravity well that it glows red-hot.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The planet itself seems to groan under the pressure of being so close to the monstrous Kcalbeloh, constantly shifting and cracking under your ship like cheap pie crust.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded3 = This place is about as structurally sound as Untitled Space Craft (before the addition of moar struts).
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = Mission parameters did not account for the temperature measuring unit to be exposed to this extreme of conditions. However, it does its job anyway, and kindly informs you that it’s… *balmy.*
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = It should NOT be this hot without a star nearby. Mass does scary things, usually at Onrefni’s expense.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = You liken the experience of walking on Onrefni as walking on large flakes of breakfast cereal, as you “hear” the crack of the surface reverberate up through your leg with each bounding step.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = Your feet are… substantially hotter than your head, as your currently panicking EVA suit operating system kindly informs you.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfLanded3 = You find it difficult to move along the uneven, stretched-out looking surface, as the top layer of rock flakes off with each heavy bound created by your inherently clumsy attempts to move in 32% of Kerbin’s gravity.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The Goo seems to shiver in the far reaches of its capsule at the realization it is on a planet so close to Kcalbeloh.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The Goo appears to separate into different layers, as if imitating the inner geology of the shattered dwarf planet it rests on.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The samples you carefully collect appear greatly flattened and warped compared to “conventional” extraplanetary samples seen on previous missions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The rocks you collect are warm even through your suit gloves, and you feel a pang of sympathy for the, admittedly, inanimate yet tortured objects.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Onrefni_SrfLanded3 = You notice a fine particle dusting on the samples you collect that seems to coat everything on Onrefni, and you assume said dust is created and deposited by the nearby accretion disk of Kcalbeloh and the slow yet active breakup of the dwarf planet itself simultaneously.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The metal samples quickly puddle under the alien light of Kcalbeloh, and the volatile samples such as the ice begin to sublimate in short order upon being exposed to the harsh vacuum around Onrefni.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The pervasive, electrically charged dust that cakes the surface of Onrefni quickly begins to coat the interior of the materials bay. Much to your annoyance, the volatile dust causes the bay’s electronics to short, decommissioning your expensive new science experiment just moments after it collected some useful data.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded = The seismic instrument is utterly deluged in data stemming from both extreme tidal forces and near-constant impacts from the material in the nearby accretion disk, which characterizes the chaotic nature of Onrefni to a great degree.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded1 = The gravity readings fluctuate ever so slightly depending on where on Onrefni the readings are taken, likely due to the small world’s unstable terrain and wrecked interior geology.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded2 = The gravity on Onrefni, while certainly unstable, usually settles around a level that is comparable, yet slightly higher than Duna’s surface gravity. This fact backs up the theory hinted at by prior scientific readings as to the small world possessing a heavy iron core, as such a small body usually does not possess such high gravity.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = This isn’t what we meant by thorough exploration. The implication was that you were coming home - Ok. It’s too late now.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = You recall not being paid enough for this as you watch your vessel turn into metallic fondue.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = This is a crime against thermometers, and you know it. Sadly, it is too late to rectify your actions, as the thermometer has melted and is no longer with us.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = Why bother? You knew the answer. T O O   H O T .
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = You know, it was inevitable that someone denser than Kcalbeloh such as yourself slipped through the rigorous KSP kerbonaut selection process just to walk into lava on an alien dwarf planet. Enjoy your final seconds of existence, o… brave one!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = Thank you for your meaningful contribution to science and for your sacrifice just to discover that, get this: LAVA IS HOT!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = The Goo deserved better, but at least it perished in the line of duty to Kerbalkind.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = The Goo survives the unbelievable heat for longer than one would anticipate, but even it succumbs to Onrefni’s fury quickly.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfSplashed1 = It melted. Absolute shocker, that.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_SrfSplashed2 = KSC advises you to not be so reckless with expensive hardware in the future simply to verify if the lava was, in fact, hot.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed = The gravity sensor spits out nonsensical series of data as it begins to melt under the punishing heat of Onrefni’s infernos.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = You have a slight hesitation at the concept of landing on the shattered world below you.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = You REALLY don’t want to land down there. The surface looks about as friendly as a rabid Kolar Bear.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = The thermometer does not yet suspect the wrath that lies below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = You’re not even on the surface yet and your temperature measuring units are already protesting, picket signs and all.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = You do not enjoy floating just above literal rivers of lava. The sensation is akin to standing just next to a hot water heater, even through your suit.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = Between the heat of the torn planet and the heat of Kcalbeloh on the opposing side, you feel akin to a microwaved meal while on EVA, and your coolant systems quickly demand a raise.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = If you didn’t know better, you’d say that the inanimate Goo seemed to be actively shrinking away from the small, broken world below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = The Goo erratically ricochets off of its containment canister, seeming to try to find a means of escape from it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceLow1 = The electronic suite in the materials bay reacts in a peculiar manner to the uniquely extreme environment around this small world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceLow2 = You observe the magnetic testing equipment lighting up like a Christmas tree within the materials bay whenever the black hole is in view of the instrumentation. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = The sensor struggles to quantify the game of planetary tug-of-war being played around it by the black hole and Onrefni.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = The boom quickly makes the theory that Onrefni possesses a heavy, proportionally immense metallic core credible, as it picks up the dwarf planet's somewhat strong (for its size) magnetic signature.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = You didn’t know a space rock could look evil… until today, that is.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = How did this plucky little ball even come to form so close around Big Boy over there?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = The black hole’s enormous heat readings still smother the estimated temperature data of the cracked rock beneath you at this distance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = You’ll need to get closer to Onrefni to get away from Nosey the Black Hole’s vast heat signature and get any meaningful data beyond “probably H O T (and bright).”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = You do your best “insignificant speck” impression. Hey, great job!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = You try to decide whether Onrefni is really small, or if Kcalbeloh is just really, really big. Maybe both? Further study is required.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = The Goo seems to be inert, as if paralyzed with the size of the nearby black hole in comparison to the comparatively miniscule Onrefni.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = The Goo stretches to opposite sides of its container, as if emulating the tidal forces that have shattered the little world below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh1 = Before embarking on this mission, you didn’t think material samples could show fear, being inanimate objects and all. You were wrong. Those samples look utterly terrified in the presence of the cosmic horror that is Kcalbeloh, while also hurtling towards the troubled rock below at unimaginable speed.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh2 = Some of the magnetically sensitive samples seem to slightly gravitate between both the black hole and the dwarf planet far below, which indicates that Onrefni possesses a large iron core, not dissimilar to Moho.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = At this distance, any substantial gravity readings from the small planet that would have otherwise been obvious are drowned out by the suffocating signature of Kcalbeloh.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = Even at this distance, a surprisingly ample magnetic signature radiates from Onrefni. The magnetic field's shape is perturbed by the overpowering field of Kcalbeloh, but there's SOMETHING there. You'll need to get closer to verify these readings.

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Midlands = The lights from within your crew cabin illuminate just far enough to see the sandy bottom of the ocean where your craft has settled after sinking so far.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Highlands = Against the crushing blackness of the ocean depths, you can see outcroppings of rock and - if your eyes are to be believed - underwater mountains. Maybe these are what drives the monsterous waves on the surface.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfLanded_Cracks = Your ship, now settled at the very lowest depths of the ocean, groans under the strain of the entire ocean pressing down on it. This is deeper than you imagined the ocean went...

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Lowlands = As you peer out of the crew cabin, you see the saltwater of Rouqea was over the view port, partially obscuring the horison. That's funny, the horison doesn't look as flat as it should be on an ocean planet...
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Midlands = From your crew cabin, the waters look calm around you. You close your eyes and relax, listening to the sound of the waves lapping against the hull of your craft. 
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Highlands = The crew module gives a fantastic view over Rouqea's calm oceans, standing up at your seat lets you see all the way to the mountains on the horison. Wait...
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_SrfSplashed_Cracks = Floating over the deepest parts of Rouqea's planetary ocean, you note how choppy the waves are becoming and in the distance, how tall they crest! Some of them reaching up nearly to the clouds!
                //Low Flying
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Lowlands = From your crew module, you can see the clouds around and above you, and the calm sea below you. It's hard not to be a little unnerved by how close you are to Kcalbeloh, though.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Midlands = Your cockpit gives a wonderful view of the ocean, which stretches all around you. In the distance, you catch a glimps of a wave hundreds of meters tall as it slinks off over the horison.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Highlands = Rolling the craft, the view port catches a wonderful display; the clouds bowing out of the way, making room for a wave of titanic magnitude. With these waves, you almost think you might be flying too low...
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingLow_Cracks = Around the areas of Rouqea known to be the deepest, you see columns of bubbles rise from deep underneath the planetary ocean, only to be swept away by waves the size of mountains.

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Lowlands = Its hard not to appreciate the sight you see now - the accretion disk of Kcalbeloh lighting the azure seas and skies of Rouqea.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Midlands = Your craft flies gracefully through the air above the clouds, allowing you to catch every glint of the waves far below.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Highlands = Even so high up, its hard not to notice the mountainous terrain below you. It's hard to ignore the snow lining the pea- did that mountain just move?
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_FlyingHigh_Cracks = Rouqea far below you, it's unnerving to know that the black hole that looms above is so close.

                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_InSpaceLow_Highlands = Rouqea fills your window just as much as Kcalbeloh - a toast to both the Black Hole's scale and your proximity to the giant ocean world.
                #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Rouqea_InSpaceLow_Cracks = In the calmer portions of the ocean, you can almost see a reflection of Kcalbeloh! A distorted, broken reflection, but a reflection regardless.
                //In High Space

The ice covering the surface is likely a result of the planet's frigid temperatures, and it is unclear if there are any areas on the planet that are not covered in ice.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Uleg_FlyingLow = The temperature on Uleg decreases significantly as the altitude decreases, with a difference of up to 50 degrees Celsius between the upper and lower atmosphere. This is likely due to the planet's thin atmosphere and the lack of heat-trapping gases. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Uleg_FlyingHigh = The temperature in the upper atmosphere of Uleg is extremely low, which is likely due to the planet's distance from Kcalbeloh, as well as the lack of a substantial atmosphere to trap heat. The temperature scan also shows small variations in temperature across the upper atmosphere, likely due to differences in surface topography and ice cover.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_SrfLanded = As the crew stepped out onto the icy surface of Uleg, they were struck by the intense cold and the vast expanse of frozen terrain before them. The icy landscape was dotted with rocky outcroppings. The crew also reported a sense of awe at the stark beauty of Uleg's frozen landscape, underscoring the potential for scientific discovery in even the most extreme environments.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_FlyingLow = Due to the extremely low temperatures and icy terrain, conducting an EVA in the lower atmosphere of Uleg would be highly challenging and dangerous. It is not recommended to attempt an EVA in such conditions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_FlyingHigh = Due to the extreme cold and lack of atmosphere, it is not recommended for astronauts to perform an EVA in the upper atmosphere of Uleg. The conditions would be too harsh and pose a significant risk to the safety of the crew.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_InSpaceLow = As the crew member ventured outside the spacecraft, they were able to observe the frigid planet Uleg from the darkness of space. The planet's surface was mostly covered in a thick layer of ice, giving it a stark and desolate appearance. Despite the cold and harsh conditions, the crew member marveled at the beauty of the planet against the backdrop of the infinite cosmos.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = During the EVA in high space above Uleg, the crew member observed the frigid planet's ice-covered surface and highly inclined and eccentric orbit. The breathtaking and unforgettable view highlighted the planet's unique characteristics, captured against the darkness of space.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Uleg_SrfLanded = As the crew collected surface samples from Uleg, they noticed that the ice was extremely hard and showed evidence of having been exposed to extreme temperatures. The composition of the samples suggests that the ice is composed of a mix of water, methane, and carbon dioxide, which could provide valuable insights into the planet's history and formation.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Uleg_SrfLanded = During the materials study experiment conducted on the surface of Uleg, samples of the ice were analyzed for their chemical composition and physical properties. The analysis revealed that the ice on Uleg is primarily composed of water, with small amounts of other elements and compounds present. The physical properties of the ice indicate that it is very hard and brittle, likely due to the extreme cold temperatures on the planet.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The barometer scan on Uleg's surface indicated a low atmospheric pressure, consistent with the planet's frigid temperatures and lack of significant atmosphere. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Uleg_FlyingLow = The barometer scan conducted in Uleg's lower atmosphere revealed a significantly lower air pressure. The readings indicate that the planet's atmosphere is extremely thin and unsuitable for respiration.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Uleg_FlyingHigh = The pressure would be too low for the instrument to detect any meaningful data. The thin atmosphere would not allow the barometer to function accurately.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = During the seismic scan on Uleg's surface, the equipment recorded several minor tremors, indicating that the planet may still be geologically active, even though its surface is mostly frozen. Further analysis of the data will be needed to determine the source of these tremors and their potential implications for the planet's geology.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The crew conducted a gravity scan on the surface of Uleg. The results showed variations in the planet's gravitational field, indicating the presence of relatively hollow regions beneath the icy surface. Further analysis is needed to determine the nature and composition of these regions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Uleg_InSpaceLow = During the gravity scan experiment in low space above Uleg, the spacecraft was able to measure the planet's gravitational field. The readings showed a weaker gravitational force than expected, indicating that Uleg has a low density and may have a partially hollow interior.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = A gravity scan was conducted on planet Uleg from a spacecraft in high orbit. The scan revealed significant variations in the planet's gravitational field, indicating the presence of less dense subsurface materials.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Uleg_InSpace = The data collected showed a weak magnetic field, likely due to the planet's lack of a substantial iron core. The results will be useful for understanding Uleg's geology and formation.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Uleg_SrfLanded = We collected gas samples and measured atmospheric pressure and composition. Preliminary results suggest that the atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and methane, with trace amounts of other gases.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_UlegFlyingLow = As the spacecraft descended into the lower atmosphere of Uleg, the atmosphere was found to be thin and composed mainly of nitrogen gas. Methane and carbon dioxide were detected in trace amounts. The analysis also showed that the atmospheric pressure increased with decreasing altitude.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_UlegFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis in the upper atmosphere of planet Uleg revealed a high concentration of nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, suggesting that the planet may be experiencing some form of geological activity. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure was found to be extremely low, indicating that Uleg's upper atmosphere is very thin.
           

        // Maelg
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow1 = The body just outside the ship’s porthole seems not to glare and as a true star would, but mainly seems to gently bathe the hull and the surrounding bodies in a gentle glow.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow2 = From this close distance, the banding of the brown dwarf is clearly visible, further hinting towards its status of “not-quite-fusion.”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Maelg_InSpaceLow = While the thermometer kindly informs you that Maelg is indeed quite hot, it also reveals that it is only about a third as hot as Kerbol at its “surface.”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow1 = At this close distance to the brown dwarf with only your seemingly flimsy suit protecting you from its still-blazing temperatures, you question the Kerbal scientists that described the failed star to you and your crew as “small and dim” during the mission briefing.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceLow2 = The light emanating from Maelg is not as harsh as you would have expected, and is actually somewhat pleasant.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The unprotected Goo still quickly begins to cook and sublimate in the close-contact with Maelg, despite the brown dwarf’s technically low temperature (in stellar terms, that is).
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The lead samples and the other softer metals begin to bubble and float out of the materials bay in the heat-lamp like gleam of Maelg, while the hardier samples simply begin to glow with internal heat, not dissimilarly to the  stellar body just below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The indicated gravity at Maelg’s surface could be compared to a substantially more extreme version of Jool’s already powerful gravity well, as despite its (relatively speaking) small size, the failed star is able to hang onto Mehtna and Meiuqer quite securely, despite interference from the other nearby systems and Kcalbeloh itself.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Maelg_InSpaceLow = The magnetometer reveals the fury that stews within the otherwise dim and feeble-looking Maelg, as it picks up on its violently strong magnetic field and the resulting radiation belts. KSC informs you to think of it as Jool's magnetic fields on steriods... times 50.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh1 = From this distance, Maelg almost has you fooled as to being a star. Almost is the key word here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh2 = All the way out here, Maelg seems to be but a dim night-light compared to the halogen floodlights of the stars you’re used to seeing. It is certainly not at all comparable to the unholy wrath of Kcalbeloh, or even Kerbol.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = From this distance, Maelg is not heavily detected by the temperature unit. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh1 = From here, Maelg reminds you of a lightbulb filament, gently glowing by itself in the infinite darkness. Compared to the cosmic horror evoked by Kcalbeloh, Maelg is quite comforting. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Maelg_InSpaceHigh2 = Even though the vacuum of space prevents you from physically doing so, you can’t help but feel warmed by Maelg’s gentle light. It is easily the most comfortable you’ve been on this trip so far.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to take up an amber tone similar to everything else in the Maelg system. Or is it just a trick of the dim light blanketing everything within eyeshot?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = The majority of the samples remain inert at this distance from the brown dwarf, with the notable exception of seemingly taking on the sepia tone of the failed star below. However, the magnetic testing bay within the materials lab indicates that Maelg has a very strange and powerful magnetic field and is likely quite volatile, despite its gentle appearance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = At this distance, Maelg’s gravity well is a bit faint compared to true stars like Kerbol, but is still palpable and far surpasses even the most massive of planets.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = From up here, the magnetic field detected is still quite tame, as is the rest of Maelg. The closer you get however, the stronger the violence within the brown dwarf will become relative to you and your diminutive ship.

        //Mehtna
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = You can’t help but be reminded of vintage photographs as you look out upon the seemingly sepia surface of Mehtna from the lander’s windows.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = Compared to some of the more extreme destinations on showcase in Kcalbeloh’s neighborhood, this is all a welcome change of pace.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded3 = You cannot help but feel comforted and even somewhat drowsy on this small, Duna-like sepia world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded_TempLow = On this side of the planet, the atmosphere partially condenses and falls to the ground in a sort of slush due to the extreme cold, not dissimilar to Duna’s poles, although in a much reduced fashion compared to that world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded_TempHigh = On this side of Mehtna, the thin atmosphere is heated substantially by the dim Maelg, and proves that no part of this barren, amber world is at all capable of supporting life, hot or cold side notwithstanding.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = You feel that everything around you resembles a faded, vintage photograph. Your own skin seems to take on an uncharacteristic amber tone.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = You get the peculiar sense while standing upon Mehtna that this world is truly dead, akin to a depleted battery.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_SrfLanded3 = It is doubtful that solar panels would do you much good in this dim setting.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = The Goo seems to both harden and take on a sepia tone, and also sublimates slightly in the tenuous atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = The Goo no longer emanates warmth internally, and seems to become as lifeless as Mehtna itself. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = The samples you collect seem to not be totally structurally sound once moved, as if fragile from being static for so long.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = These samples will undoubtedly prove to be useful, as they are quite ancient judging from the seemingly unchanged environment that is the Mehtnian surface.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Mehtna_SrfLanded3 = The samples themselves appear to be a healthy mix of substrate and ancient chunks of ice.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_SrfLanded1 = Depending on orientation of the bay itself, the volatile samples in the materials bay cycle between sublimation and freezing solid. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_SrfLanded2 = The samples (with the notable exception of the water sample, which quickly boils off) remain mainly unchanged, besides seeming to react ever so slightly with the surrounding thin atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The barometer confirms the tenuous nature of Mehtna’s atmosphere, although it also indicates that it is quite a bit thicker than Duna’s atmosphere. However, in comparison to planets like Roquea or even moons like Efil, this atmosphere is of little consequence.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The seismic scans indicate that the only detectable activity on this lonely planet is caused by the occasional impact.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The gravity on this world is quite substantial compared to some other destinations throughout the solar system and beyond, coming in at just over half of Kerbin’s gravity. You find it to be a happy medium ground to effectively explore this tomb of a world without being bogged down or flying off too far with each step.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The atmospheric analyzer indicates that the thin atmosphere of this planet consists mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a healthy amount of trace gasses. Mehtna would be a prime candidate for atmospheric resource harvesting!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_FlyingLow = You look out upon the strange planet below, noting that the geography appears to be totally alien. This is likely caused by the… unique solar situation Mehtna faces.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The atmosphere’s temperature constantly fluctuates depending on where the craft is above the surface.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_FlyingLow = This has to be against program safety guidelines. Luckily, the KSC is [REDACTED] light-years away, so they don’t have to know. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The exposed Goo flaps in the wind, but only ever so slightly. It sublimates as it does so, leaving a small trail of steam as the craft descends.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The farther you descend into the atmosphere of Mehtna, the less the volatile samples sublimate; however, they never cease to do so completely.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The pressure, even at this low altitude quite literally, is noticeably less at the top of the vessel than it is at the bottom of it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_FlyingLow = Precise gravity scans are not yet possible at this altitude due to the thin atmosphere being just substantial enough to unsettle the vessel and cause oscillations, throwing off the instrument. However, this in turn gives you some estimated wind speeds (and some ballpark gravity statistics, as intended)!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Mehtna_FlyingLow = The atmospheric analyzer indicates that the thin atmosphere of this planet consists mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a healthy amount of trace gasses. Mehtna would be a prime candidate for atmospheric resource harvesting!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = You look out upon the strange planet far below, noting that the geography appears to be totally alien. This is likely caused- You have to stop looking however, as the force of atmospheric entry almost causes you to hit your head on the interior of your helmet if you keep turning to look out the window.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = The planet’s average temperature can only be roughly estimated at this altitude, due to how thin the atmosphere is. However, up here, it be cold. Shocker, we know.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = Are you TRYING to get torn off the ship’s ladder by wind shear and thrown into Kraken-knows-what at Mach 2?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = The Goo violently shudders with the rest of the vessel, while also seeming to fade in color to the same brownish tint as everything around it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = Many of the samples are shaken loose by the force of atmospheric entry, but otherwise do not yet react significantly to their surroundings. You do however note that the solar power experiment in the bay fails to collect anything but a trickle from Maelg’s faint light… before being shaken loose and thrown into the heavy metals section of the bay, heavily damaging it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = At this altitude, the atmosphere is far too tenuous to do much but shake your vessel as you descend farther towards the strange, beige-tinted world below.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = Despite the perturbations caused by the vessel’s entry into the Mehtnian atmosphere, the gravity on the surface is estimated to be roughly equivalent to .5 Gs or so. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Mehtna_FlyingHigh = The atmospheric analyzer indicates that the thin atmosphere of this planet consists mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a healthy amount of trace gasses. Mehtna would be a prime candidate for atmospheric resource harvesting!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow1 = The world below you reminds you of a muddied pond, or perhaps a polished ball of wood.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow2 = You can’t help but find Mehtna as a bit of an ugly duckling compared to the likes of Suluco or Aroura, but it does have a sort of comforting charm to it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = While the world looks desolate and static from this altitude, the thermometric instruments imply that at least thermally speaking, Mehtna is quite varied.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow1 = The brown planet bathes you in its light, and you suddenly find yourself craving chocolate.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceLow2 = Upon seeing Mehtna up close, you have the sudden urge to throw a mudball at one of your crewmates upon returning to Kerbin.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The Goo decomposes and takes up the appearance and consistency of hot fudge, perhaps in response to the unique radiation environment produced by Maelg.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The samples seem to be indifferent to their surroundings, with a lack of activity in the bay (minus the water samples quietly sizzling away, but nobody asked about you, Water Samples). 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The gravity below is estimated to be about half of Kerbin’s gravity, maybe a tiny bit more.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = The magnetic field detected could be equated to being somewhat similar to Duna's, only amplified. This is likely due to the two planets sharing a number of qualities, only with Mehtna being substantially larger.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh1 = You attempt to clean the small brown stain off of the ship’s window… Oh. Wait a second. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh2 = If this small solar (or technically, brown dwarf?) system was a wine, you would describe it as, “Brown, with overtones of beige and a hint of sepia, perhaps just a mere touch of orange zest.”
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The thermometer’s readings emphasize the relative weakness of Maelg’s heating compared to a star.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh1 = You think there’s a small brown bug in your helmet and you begin to panic, until your crew kindly reminds you of where you are.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh2 = The faint light of Maelg refracts through the muddy-looking atmosphere of Mehtna in a strange manner, as it makes said atmosphere look both thick and thin at the same time. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to drift towards the planet and Maelg as much as it can given its confined nature, seemingly in an attempt to feel warmth.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = Most of the samples appear to be normal, but a few of the more fragile experiments appear to have frozen in the low-heat setting this far from Maelg. You can only imagine how cold Meiuqer must be.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The gravity below is estimated to be about half of Kerbin’s gravity, maybe a tiny bit more.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = The magnetometer reports that while a bit weak, Mehtna does indeed possess a palpable magnetic field! The field is not strong enough to protect anything on the surface from the solar/interstellar radiation from Maelg and all the other nearby solar systems, however.

        //Meiuqer
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = This dusty, cold little space potato is still undeniably fascinating to you and your crew.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = From this distance, Maelg’s already faint light fades to near-insignificance.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded3 = The surface of Meiuqer appears as if it’s been thawed and frozen repeatedly for some time, akin to ice cream left to melt and then later refrozen.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = While the temperature on this small, strange world does fluctuate quite often in its orbit, it is never “warm” by any stretch of the imagination.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = The thermometer tells you the obvious in this particular situation: C O L D ! 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = As you stand on the surface of Meiuqer, you are careful not to sneeze and reach escape velocity. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = You wield infinite cosmic power. You lightly threw a nearby rock, and it has begun orbiting Meiuqer. Gotta love low gravity.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Meiuqer_SrfLanded3 = Man, you thought Gilly was hard to navigate. At least Gilly isn’t seemingly dark all the time or tinted like vintage film. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = The Goo freezes solid and dings against its container, loosening it and causing it to float away in a solid mass at Meiuqer’s escape velocity.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = The Goo nearly floats around in its capsule as if still in microgravity, especially once it begins to both sublimate and freeze in Meiuqer’s hard vacuum environment.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = You have to be careful while gathering your samples not to float away from Meiuqer.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = The samples you collect are quite remarkable. While Mehtna is undoubtedly ancient, Meiuqer is quite literally untouched since its formation, minus whatever effects are caused by its regular drastic temperature changes as it swings close and far away from Maelg on its highly eccentric orbital path.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Meiuqer_SrfLanded3 = Now that samples have been obtained from this strange little world, it is clear that Meiuqer is a “rubble-pile” type asteroid, owing to its substantial radius being in spite of it having a weaker gravity field than the much smaller Gilly.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Meiuqer_SrfLanded1 = The samples do not react to much upon being exposed to Meiuqer, besides the volatile samples being quickly vaporized and/or freezing solid.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Meiuqer_SrfLanded2 = Besides sublimation, the only thing observed in the material lab is the electrical experiment becoming unstable and shorting due to the dust that surrounds Meiuqer coating it within just a few minutes of exposure. The dust is apparently being electrically charged by Maelg, or is at least conductive to electricity to an extent.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded = The seismic scans of Meiuqer unsurprisingly reveal that the small world is entirely dead and may as well be a giant potato floating in the vacuum of space.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded = You attempt to measure the gravity on Meiuqer. The sensor’s display barely goes that low, but you get your reading.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_InSpaceLow1 = The surface is somewhat obscured by Meiuqer’s dusty exosphere, but it is not at all comparable to a true atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Meiuqer_InSpaceLow2 = You observe as a small rock impacts Meiuqer at moderate speed, sending a car sized boulder floating off from the surface.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Suluco_SrfSplashed_ColdOcean = The goo escapes into the water... and then promptly returns to the containment unit as it does not want to freeze.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Suluco_FlyingLow = The goo jiggles around as the craft vibrates. 
                        
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Suluco_SrfLanded_Day = The material study conducted on the day hemisphere of Suluco, the region that is perpetually bathed in sunlight, has yielded intriguing findings. The surface materials analyzed show signs of extensive weathering and erosion, likely caused by the harsh solar radiation and constant exposure to sunlight. The high temperatures on this side of the planet have resulted in the formation of unique mineral compositions and structures, suggesting the presence of novel geological processes. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Suluco_SrfLanded_Twilight = The twilight zone of Suluco exhibits complex organic compounds and a unique blend of geological and chemical processes. The surface materials suggest the presence of exotic alien life and provide insights into the planet's biology and astrobiology. The dynamic winds and perpetual twilight have shaped the geology and chemistry of this region, providing valuable insights into Suluco's biology, astrobiology, and geological history. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Suluco_SrfLanded_Night = The night hemisphere of Suluco, the perpetually dark side of the planet, presents unique challenges for material study due to extreme environmental conditions, including freezing temperatures and lack of sunlight. Initial analysis of surface materials reveals the presence of frozen water and volatile compounds, providing valuable insights into the planet's geology and chemical composition.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Suluco_SrfSplashed = Conducting a material study in the oceans of Suluco has yielded intriguing results. Analysis of water samples collected from the oceans reveals unique chemical properties, including high concentrations of rare minerals and organic compounds not found in other parts of the planet. The persistent strong winds in the twilight zone are believed to play a role in the ocean's composition, impacting the distribution of materials and shaping the planet's exotic alien life forms.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_SrfLanded_Day = The barometer scan in Suluco's day hemisphere confirms the presence of a low-pressure zone on the surface of the day hemisphere, where the air is heated by the star, rises, and decreases in density. This rising air moves towards the night hemisphere at high altitudes. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_SrfLanded_Twilight = A barometer scan conducted in Suluco's twilight zone reveals a unique atmospheric pressure pattern influenced by the stark temperature difference between the day and night hemispheres. The scan indicates that the twilight zone experiences persistent strong winds towards the day hemisphere, likely driven by the temperature contrast between the adjacent day and night hemispheres. The narrow ring of twilit eternity creates a dynamic and turbulent atmospheric region with varying pressures. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_SrfLanded_Night = The barometer measurements reveal a higher atmospheric pressure on the surface of the night hemisphere, because the air from the day hemisphere cools and descends when arriving at the night hemisphere, becoming denser, and creating a high-pressure area. The descended air then travels along the surface back towards the day hemisphere, closing the loop of the atmospheric circulation. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_FlyingLow = The barometer scan conducted in Suluco's lower atmosphere reveals a complex pressure distribution pattern. In the day hemisphere, where the air is heated by the star, the scan indicates a low-pressure zone, because of the rising air due to heating and decreased density. In contrast, the night hemisphere exhibits a high-pressure area in the low atmosphere, because of the descending air due to cooling and increased density. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Suluco_FlyingHigh = The barometer scan conducted in Suluco's upper atmosphere, taking into account the global atmospheric conditions, provides valuable insights into the complex pressure distribution patterns influenced by the planet's tidally locked configuration and temperature contrast between the day and night hemispheres.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Suluco_SrfLanded = The seismic scan indicates that Suluco is relatively geological stable. However, the persistent strong winds can create friction and stress on the planet's surface, potentially leading to ground tremors. Also, the twilight zone of Suluco experiences higher levels of ground tremors, likely caused by the frictional forces generated by the persistent winds, as well as the differential heating and cooling of the surface in the day and night hemispheres.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Suluco = The global gravity scan of Suluco reveals a relatively consistent gravitational field across the planet's surface with no significant variations or anomalies. The gravity strength is found to be similar in both the day and night hemispheres, as well as in the region between them known as the twilight zone.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_SulucoInSpace = The magnetometer measurements indicate that Suluco has a weak and relatively uniform magnetic field across its surface in the low orbit region.  There are no significant variations or anomalies detected in the magnetic field strength. The lack of significant magnetic field variations suggests that Suluco's magnetic field is likely generated by its internal geodynamo, similar to other terrestrial planets. 

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Suluco = The atmosphere of Suluco is primarily composed of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), with traces of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and other minor gases. The average air pressure of Suluco is lower than Kerbin, so be careful not to do intense sports.

        // Tot
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Tot_SrfLanded = It almost feels like we could deorbit this thing just by pushing on it hard enough with out spacecraft.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Tot_InSpace = Come on, we can easily build spaceships bigger than this rock!
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Tot_SrfLanded = Don't jump. You might actually escape this rock's gravity by jumping off of it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Tot_InSpace = Do we really need to land on this tiny rock? We could easily just send someone down and back up using nothing but their EVA jetpack.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Tot_SrfLanded = The goo seems at home on Tot. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Tot_InSpaceLow = The goo continues to laugh. You then threaten to weld its containment unit shut, at which point it finally complies with your request to stop laughing.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Tot_InSpaceHigh = The goo appears to laugh as it senses Tot's presence. You slam its containment unit in a futile attempt to silence it.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Tot_SrfLanded = Analysis of Tot's surface suggests that it might just be a captured asteroid. You can't be certain about this, though.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Tot_SrfLanded = The seismic scanner reads...... nothing.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Tot_SrfLanded = Finally, the gravity sensor focuses on Tot now that it is literally right next to this tiny little rock. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Tot_InSpaceLow = The gravity sensor still points towards Suluco. Out of frustration, you do a hard reset of the gravity sensor, only for it to turn its attention to Suluco once again.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Tot_InSpaceHigh = The gravity sensor seems much more interested in Suluco than this tiny thing. Trying to get it to focus on Tot would be an exercise in futility.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Tot_InSpaceLow = The boom is unable to detect any magnetic fields coming from Tot
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Tot_InSpaceHigh = You measure a moderately strong magnetic field, but it appears to be from Suluco and not from...... whatever this thing is.
   

        // Sera
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Sera_SrfLanded = The kerbals alert the KSC that they landed on Sera and are preparing their sample jars.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Sera_SrfSplashed = The kerbals alert the KSC that the splashed down on Sera and are preparing their water bottles.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Sera_FlyingLow = The crew agrees that Sera is an amazing sight to behold with it's ring system.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Sera_FlyingHigh = Your kerbals are mesmerized at the sight of Sera's rings.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Sera_SrfLanded = You could probably go skiing, if there was any snow...
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Sera_SrfSplashed = You probably shouldn't swim in this water.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Sera_FlyingLow = A gush of chilly wind almost pushes you off of the ship. Close call!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Sera_FlyingHigh = It's pretty cold out here isn't it?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Sera_InSpace = It's cold. I mean, what did you expect?

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Sera_SrfLanded = The surface of Sera is a barren, rocky landscape with scattered boulders dotting the landscape. The striking ring system of Sera arcs overhead, casting long shadows over the rocky terrain below. The lakes are clearly visible from the surface. The absence of any plant or animal life on the surface reinforces the impression of a desolate, inhospitable world. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Sera_SrfSplashed = The surface of Sera's lakes is a surreal and eerie landscape. The brown hues of the lakes reflect off of the kerbal's visor, casting an otherworldly glow over everything. The surrounding terrain is barren and rocky, with no vegetation or signs of life. The toxic nature of the lake makes it impossible for any known lifeform to survive. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Sera_FlyingLow = Descending through the lower atmosphere of Sera is a harrowing experience. The winds howl and buffet the kerbal as they plummet towards the planet's rocky surface, making it difficult to maintain control. Despite the challenging conditions, the view is breathtaking. The planet's rugged terrain stretches out below, peppered with giant rocks and mountain ranges. The atmosphere is thick and hazy, with a reddish tint caused by the high concentration of iron oxide particles in the air. Despite the beauty of the planet, the conditions here are incredibly harsh. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Sera_FlyingHigh = The planet's rocky surface recedes into the distance, replaced by a swirling maelstrom of clouds and gases. The atmosphere here is thin and wispy, with a red-yellow hue. Despite the beauty of the planet from this height, the conditions here are incredibly harsh. This is a dangerous but essential area to explore for those seeking to unravel the mysteries of this barren, rocky world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Sera_InSpaceLow = It is a stark, lifeless world, with nothing to break up the monotony of its endless surface except for the striking ring system that encircles it. Conducting an EVA in the low space above Sera provides a unique perspective on this desolate planet, allowing researchers to observe it from a distance and study its features with incredible detail. The conditions here are challenging, with extreme temperatures and high radiation levels.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Sera_InSpaceHigh = Sera is an impressive sight from high above, with its beautiful ring system and barren, rocky surface stretching out below. As you floated weightlessly above the planet, you were struck by the desolation of the landscape and the toxic, lifeless lakes that dot its surface.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Sera_SrfLanded = The goo is cold and has a small ammount of orange dust on it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Sera_SrfSplashed = The goo got wet as you splashed down.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Sera_FlyingLow = The goo is starting to freeze.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Sera_FlyingHigh = The goo is wobbling around in it's container as you reenter.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Sera_SrfLanded = The surface sample collected from Sera is composed of a fine-grained, reddish-brown regolith that appears to have been eroded by frequent dust storms and wind. Chemical analysis of the sample reveals a high concentration of heavy metals, including iron, aluminum, and titanium, as well as smaller amounts of other elements such as silicon and calcium. While the presence of heavy metals suggests a potentially rich mineral composition, the lack of any detectable signs of organic compounds or other indicators of life suggests that Sera is not suitable for sustaining life as we know it. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Sera_SrfSplashed = The sample collected from one of Sera's lakes is composed of water. Chemical analysis of the sample reveals a high concentration of heavy metals and other toxic compounds. However, the lack of any detectable signs of life suggests that Sera is not suitable for sustaining life as we know it.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Sera_SrfLanded = The dust that was kicked up while landing coats the materials in a fine, orange dust.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Sera_SrfSplashed = The water seeps into the unit, corroding the materials.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Sera_FlyingLow = A thin layer of ice coats the materials.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Sera_FlyingHigh = A thin layer of ice coats the materials.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Sera_InSpace = The materials freeze as they are exposed to outer space.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Sera_InSpaceLow = What a surprise! The device reads 0, as if it were in a vacuum in space above Sera!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Sera_InSpaceHigh = The device reads 0, as if it were in a vacuum in space high above Sera!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Sera_SrfLanded = The seismic scan conducted on Sera's crust and mantle reveals a highly tectonically active planet, with frequent seismic activity. The planet's crust is fractured, with extensive networks of faults and fissures, likely caused by the stresses induced by the planet's ring system. However, the lack of any detectable signs of organic compounds or other indicators of life suggests that Sera is not suitable for sustaining life as we know it 

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Sera_Srf = The gravity is just a tiny bit higher than that of kerbin at 1.08 gees.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Sera_InSpace = Sera appears to have a relatively strong magnetic field, protecting the planet from Sunroc's solar winds.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Sera_SrfLanded = The atmospheric analysis conducted on the surface of Sera reveals a barren and lifeless environment, with no detectable signs of organic compounds or other indicators of life. The atmosphere is thick and composed primarily of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with trace amounts of other gases such as argon and methane. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Sera_FlyingLow = The atmospheric analysis conducted on the lower atmosphere of Sera reveals a thick and hazy environment, with a composition primarily of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and trace amounts of other gases such as argon and methane. Additionally, the lower atmosphere of Sera exhibits a significant amount of dust and particulate matter, which suggests the presence of frequent dust storms or atmospheric disturbances.  However, the lack of any detectable signs of organic compounds in Sera's atmosphere suggests that the planet is not suitable for sustaining life as we know it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Sera_FlyingHigh = The atmospheric analysis conducted on the upper atmosphere of Sera reveals a thin and tenuous environment, with traces of several gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. However, the upper atmosphere of Sera exhibits a surprisingly high concentration of charged particles, which suggests the presence of a strong magnetic field around the planet. However, the lack of any detectable signs of organic compounds in Sera's atmosphere suggests that the planet is not suitable for sustaining life as we know it. 

        // Dipuc
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Lowlands = How can one differentiate the elevation-based regions? Yes, by comparing it to the surrounding higher-elevation areas, but how "low" are the Lowlands relative to... "sea"-level? Speaking of which, what counts as mean "sea level" on a dry vacuum celestial such as Dipuc, the lowest non-volcanic vent point in the crust, or an arbitrary depth set by... what committee or individual? With the lack of standardization present, one might as well open the hatch for fresh air in frustration.\n\n\n...wait- 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Midlands = The Midlands, a very... "mid" place to be. Perhaps you landed here on the possibility of increased concentrations of viable materials for in-situ resource utilization? Otherwise, I recommend you move to the Lowlands for safer and milder colony construction-friendly areas, or to the Highlands and Mountains for literally loftier challenges, there's not much else here, unless you have a rover with you or are in an encapsulated rover and wish to ride some waves... static waves, I might add.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Highlands = The Highlands, higher than most places-to-be on Dipuc and a marvel to gaze one's surroundings from. The Mountains surpass this area in terms of perspective splendor, however. Prospective resource harvesters may begin excavating to their heart's content, scouting the increasingly steep landscape, or pretending to not have nightmares about Rouquea's ever-titantic tides.\n\n\nYes, there are ACTUAL mountains here that do not move rapidly in a short time-frame, so ideally, one should fret not concerning the possibility of mortality on a lonely moon like this.\n\n...Unless you are a drooling dunderhead or are Danny or Dennis and wish to sacrifice some Kerbals to the Kraken.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Mountains = "Those aren't waves, they're mountains," says Gene Kerman to a panic-stricken Rouquea veteran. He states that the mountains are "immobile, static, and creamy-hued," not "mobile, dynamic, and ultramarine-tinted." In addition, mass spectrometry and gravimetric scans yield high concentrations of heavier silicates, sulfates, carbonates, and oxides embedded within several mountainous strata, materials and subterranean strcutures obviously not found in kilometer-high waves comprised entirely of an impure liquid mixture of myriads of minerals and organics in dissolved diatomic oxygenated dihydrogen monoxide. "Now get to traversing the rest of Dipuc's surface, mine away at the soil - preferably not with a pickaxe considering that any mining ejecta may prove hazardous to the excavating Kerbal or equipment - or begin colony establishment here, lest the consumed tons' worth of delta-v be for naught!"\n\n-Gene
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Poles = Ah, the polar regions, where snow abounds and frigid temperatures are the norm.\n\nWait, no, that's on a Kerbin-like world. Nil ice is present here. At least landing here should not have arduous, right?\n\nWhy is volcanic activity nonexistent in this particular region but abundant in the lower latitudes? Sera's tidal agitation of Dipuc's interior exhibiting the strongest effects at the regions closest to Dipuc's parent - the lower latitudes closest to the equator - could explain it, but considering Dipuc's synchronous rotation with Sera, shouldn't volcanic activity frequent its "near" side? Regardless, seeing as the landscape is no wondrous wintry environment, mind traversing further south or north of here?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterSouth = The Southern Crater appears... how far south from Dipuc's equator? Unless the vacuum skies above the current locale exhibit Sera, reference frames for the latitudinal position of the Southern Crater are merely periodic, either with the distant gravitating presence of Kcalbeloh or the illuminating Sunorc appearing for at least half of Dipuc's rotational and orbital period.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterEast = The Eastern Crater... how far east is it from the prime meridian? And what defines a specific longitude as the prime meridian? What defining feature, natural or otherwise, warrants the selection of a specific Dipuc meridian as the primary one?\n\n\nNo, Gene, this is in-universe, using the middlemost vertical line on Dipuc's colormap does not constitute a valid in-universe reason for it. And was this before or after you attempted to console a Rouquea-touched Kerbal in the Mountains, considering the hypocrisy of the latter scenario?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterWest = Hope you enjoy your tenure at the Western Crater, particularly if you lack the necessary propellant to render this one-way trip a two-way journey. Regardless, what made the Western Crater enticing enough to warrant a visit? After all, large craters like these are glorified pockmarks on the surface of vacuum worlds where such impact structures litter the surface at a regular rate. Then again, Dipuc appears to be an exception - barring the Western, Eastern, Southern, and Double Crater Complex, impact craters are scantily found here. Perhaps the internal activities and active volcanism associate with Dipuc's surface disparity relative to other small vacuum worlds like it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_DoubleCrater = Welcome to the Double Crater Complex, where you are absolutely not experiencing double vision. We are in it, after all - no internal visual artifacts or mental figments would last this long and without another Kerbal addressing your altered mental state.\n\nYou are alone in Dipuc's vacuum, aren't you? If not, cease your delusions on the existence of the Double Craters lest the rest of the crew scorn you like many informed Kerbals back home do to Flat Kerbiners or Nonexistent-Dressings.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Volcano = Concerning safety, steep-slope volcanic cones are decently hazardous for their steep incline, which may lead to several accidents that may prove detrimental to mission progression. At least the heat you would expect to emanate from the surface of an active volcanic cone is absent here, right?\n\nAnd no, there is little need to worry about volcanic eruptions here given that the vacuum environment would immediately cool erupting lava and any potential pyroclastic flows to the point of becoming slow-flowing easily avoidable lahar flows.\nJust... for Kraken's sake, never venture within proximity of the active volcanic vent.\n\n\nYou are already near it, aren't you?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_VolcanoVent = Electrical shorts and arcs? Pure-oxygen high-pressure atmosphere? Acrid odor? Prevalence of materials highly flammable in oxygen-pue atmospheres? If your vessel has one compartment that fulfills all said conditions, congratulations, an in situ simulation of the Acapello 1 fire is imminent! And if the temperature in this volcanic vent is hot enough to ignite several highly flammable materials currently residing within the vessel, may the Kraken bless you as your craft's interior begins to become a fiery enclosed pizza oven.\n\nI hope the Kraken likes baked and slightly burnt Kerbals in that case...

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow1 = Dipuc's doughy speck for a moon appears fittingly lumpy, though there are several protrusions by the lower latitudes indicative of active volcanism. The reason and modus operandi of these volcanic structures is currently unknown, though internal tidal agitation is a likely possibility. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow2 = Descending further to the surface? If so, hope you prepared enough resources to return to low Dipuc orbit or any orbiting vessel in the vicinity. Ascending further from Dipuc? Hope you enjoyed your tenure in its proximity, on the assumption that such a visit was intentional and not the result of...anomalous gravitational circumstance. If you intend to remain here, I surmise that this is intended; otherwise, you better have some cryogenic pods and Glykerol reserves, or your life support resources will steadily deplete, even with any recycling modules available.\n\n\n...You don't have any life support mods or DeepFreeze installed, don't you?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow3 = This moon is induces ennui at a greater rate than [repainted Mun], can we return to [Ares]? I do not like orbiting an oversized dough ball, one that IS NOT EVEN EDIBLE.\n\n\nAdvisory: please do not consume raw pastry or bread dough that contains any readily perishable ingredients or eggs, they may contain potentially hazardous materials or pathogens, particularly when either or both internal egg constituents are ingredients in the dough. -Mortimer
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow4 = Those mountainous regions cannot reach us... Excellent, let us descend to sample the surface and determine its composition and flavor! Oh, the surface is inedible? Why are we here then? To force the Kerbals traumatized on Rouquea to relive traumatic experiences in some sick-humor-styled exposure therapy?

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh1 = Dough ball. I am calling it. If Minmus is the mint ice cream moon, Dipuc is the dough ball moon. Surprisingly, the International Astronomical Union nigh-unanimously assented to such a notion. Seems that everyone back home is hungry for humor.\n\nAnd yes, the IAU is a thing here, though primarily to attest to the existence of that boring dwarf planet best known as Dres, or humorously as "the non-existent dwarf planet" or "the recolored Mun."
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh2 = I believe we should not be here. The orbital calculations all stated that Dipuc's sphere of influence is too diminutive to reasonably affect the orbit on the mission's time scale. Is the nearby Einstein-Rosen bridge involved in this gravitational anomaly? After all, it is how we arrived here despite the sheer distance from Kerbin.\n\n\n<color=#000000>[You did arrive here via Einstein-Rosen bridges, correct?]</color>
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh3 = When reversing the name of this moon, I must ask; what makes this moon appreciable in any sense of the word?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh4 = Welcome to Dipuc, a vacuum moon of the primarily frigid desert world Sera with a noticeable beige hue. Interestingly, few craters pockmark the surface, barring several large creater complexes, including an overlapping double crater structure. There appear to be several mounds concentrated on the lower latitudes strongly resembling stratovolcanic cones. Active or recently active volcanism? Either way, if your visit to Dipuc's outer regions is intended, mind descending further to inquire further on its surface activity?


            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Lowlands = The Lowlands are, predictably, low-elevation, at least relative to the surrounding terrain, with gentle slopes and dune-like hills encompassing the Lowlands' entirety. Local surface composition resembles those found in the Midlands and Highlands, though it appears as a loose regolith-like mix of finer particles than either biome. I do wonder, where do they get the measurements for the mean "sea-level" surface altitude, considering that there are no globally-spanning oceans to use as a basis?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Midlands = Craggy and bumpy terrain characterize the Midlands, it seems. The "sea-level"-relative elevation here is significantly higher than the mean elevation of the Lowlands. The local composition appears identical to the Lowlands and Highlands - presumably silicate material with oxides, metals, lanthanides, and the occasional actinide in between. Particle sizes are higher here, and larger stones appear to occasionally conglomerate with neighboring stones.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Highlands = The Highlands are predictably high-elevation relative to the rest of Cupid-*ahem*-Dipuc's surface, and have a similar composition to the Midlands and Lowlands. The local terrain is bumpy and steep to a degree higher than the Midlands. I highly advise remaining cautious when exploring near the steep slopes and dune-like structures here. The sizes of the particles, no, the STONES here are particularly significant and pose an impediment to smaller roving vehicles.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Mountains = Significant sea-level-relative elevations defines mountain ranges and cordilleras alike, regardless of the atmosphere of the world or the lack thereof, as is the case here. Intrinsic surface hues resemble that of the Lowlands, Midlands, and Highlands, though the texture and appearance depart from the conventions of the aforementioned three biomes. Here, the surface rocks appear to have undergone partial metamorphosis. In addition, concentrations of actinides and lanthanides abundant in the cores of differentiated celestial bodies are elevated relative to the surrounding biomes. Un-metamorphosed rocks here pose significant risks for small and medium-sized roving vehicles, though larger ones may bode well.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Poles = Dipuc's polar regions exhibit similar levels of ennui-inducing terrain to most of the surface elsewhere - similar hue, similar composition, similar temperature, et cetera. The temperature levels elicit some intrigue considering the greater distribution of Sunorc's radiation at higher latitudes, though in-flight and extravehicular activity should encounter minimal environmental impediments here as it does everywhere else barring the volcanic vents. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterSouth = The flattened regions of the Southern Giant Crater manifest lower elevations than most of the terrain encompassing it. Surface rocks indicate prior metamorphosic activity, likely from the impact event that initially generated the Southern Giant Crater. Rock hues in the locale appear slightly darker than the surrounding terrain as well, perhaps from the impact event as well? Considering Dipuc's active volcanic vents, one would surmise a combination of metamorphic and igneous rocks comprise the crater floor, though the current surface appearance appears contrary to such assumptions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterEast = The East Giant Crater appears like a vast canyon cutting through Dipuc's otherwise normal terrain, as the Highlands and Mountains and their high elevations omnidirectionally surround the Crater. Like the other craters, the surface coloration here is noticeably darker than the rest, and is especially notable upon comparison of the local surface hues to that of the surrounding Midlands and Highlands. Rocks here appear metamorphosed to a marked degree, and the surface is smoother and stiffer than the craggier, rockier, and dustier terrain characteristic of the typical biomes here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterWest = Mean elevations in the West Giant Crater resemble that of the other crater elevations, with noticeably lower ones than the surrounding terrain. The rocks here appear somewhat pulverized and powdery with a resemblance to the Mun's ever-hazardous regolith, but appear thoroughly set to the groumnd, as if some geomorphic process occurred here that compressed the diminutive rocks to the terrain. Additionally, the overall hue of the Crater is darker than the surrounding terrain. Perhaps it is due to the impact, or is it a region-specific regolith due owing to the conditions during and immediately after the impact? On a side-note, the view of the terrain encompassing the West Giant Crater appears canyon-like.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_DoubleCrater = The mean elevation in the Double Craters region is notably lower than the Lowlands'. Surface coloration is darker than the surrounding terrain, and has a different rock texture. The rocks appear somewhat metamorphic - an expected appearance, given that significant fulminant environmental changes occurred in this region owing to the double impacts.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Volcano = Relative elevation in the Volcano region is higher than the rest... for obvious reasons. The volcano is either a stratovolcano or cinder cone volcano, judging from its steep conical shape and equally steep slopes. Mean ground temperatures are likely higher here, though with all of our suits in place, it would only be detectable via ground thermometer readings. Microquake activity is also expected here - best to inquire further about that with an actual seismometer, though. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_SrfLanded_VolcanoVent = You are in a very, very precarious situation. Temperatures are high enough to permeate through your suit, and the vent is active, so might I suggest you hover over the vent instead of stepping in it lest you end up de-materializing into a puff of smoke. Other than that though, igneous rocks appear prevalent within the walls of the vent, though the lower walls appear somewhat molten yet metamorphosed from the heat. Does Sera have anything to do with this, or is Dipuc's volcanic activity independent of any mechanism from its parent planet?\n\n\nIf you wish to not end like the Acapello 1 crew, DEPART FROM THE LOCALE IMMEDIATELY.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_Lowlands = Dipuc's lowlands appear... relatively flat from here, with the occasional ripple-like "dunes" dotting the plains alongside the occasional active volcano. On the assumption that you are currently on the illuminated side of the moon, the surface hue strongly resembles bread dough.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_Midlands = Like the Lowlands, the Midlands resemble fresh bread dough in hue, though with a lumpier appearance owing to the elevated cragginess of the region.\n\nIf Dipuc's hue resembles bread dough and Minmus of minty ice cream, is there a world resembling spaghetti or pizza?\n\n\n\nAnd no, Io does not count - the current speculation concerns in-universe celestials.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_Highlands = Bumpier in appearance, the Highlands, owing to the generally higher elevations, appear closer to the craft - unless said craft orbits at hazardously low altitudes, in which case the perception of proximity should matter little with the significant risk of potential collision.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_Mountains = The mountains' proximity to the craft is... bedazzlingly intimidating. The linearity of several mountain ranges appear like waves. If it was not for the lack of atmosphere and creamy-brown hues of the mountains, one might mistake them for the titanic tides that regularly circumnavigate Rouquea.\n\nGiven Dipuc's gravitational parameter, landing on the mountainous regions and returning to a low-orbiting craft solely on EVA propellant is a possibility, much like on Minmus. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_Poles = Nil ice of any kind - water, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, et cetera is present at the poles, nor should any be expected given Dipuc's status as a diminutive vacuum world of comparable size and mass to Minmus. The poles themselves appear highly similar to the rest of the surface at lower latitudes, though no volcanic activity is present here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_CraterSouth = Ah, the South Giant Crater! An expansive... basin... of sheer flatness. Rather intuitive, given its status as a feature-defining crater of a decently feature-rich moon. One would expect a central peak to appear here, but optical and gravimetric scans yield no anomalies here indicative of even an eroded central peak.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_CraterEast = The East Giant Crater, a disappointingly flat chasm with purportedly impressive surface views that emanate the impression of standing in a particularly xeric grand canyon... or a concentric collection of towering mudslides rearing to inundate you whole in the rock-laden fluids. Visual scans yield little of note barring the slight color difference between it and the surrounding high-elevation and mountainous regions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_CraterWest = Not much of initial note here above the Western Giant Crater. A slightly darker surface hue from the high- and mid-elevation regions enveloping the crater, the lack of a central peak, and a decent view on the surface that may resemble staring into the walls of a wide canyon near the bottom, and nothing much else.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_DoubleCrater = The Double Craters impact basin primarily comprises of two impact craters, one older larger crater and a younger smaller crater as evidenced by the crater rim of the diminutive crater intruding into its expansive neighbor. A keen-eyed Kerbal may see the slight color differential between both craters' central regions and that of the low- and mid-elevation areas encompassing the complex. Given the tendency for solidified igneous rocks to manifest in darker hues, the central regions are possible candidates for prior widespread magmatic activity, providing a potential explanation for the lack of central peaks both here and in Dipuc's other major craters. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_Volcano = Volcanic activity on a world as petite as Dipuc sounds strange. The volcanoes here, surmising from their appearance, are stratovolcanic in structure - the volcanic cone consists of several repeating layers of multiple igneous rocks and volcanic ejecta from repeated eruptions considered recent by Dipuc's time scale. Landing here appears unviable owing to the steep and sloping terrain. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceLow_VolcanoVent = The volcanic vent appears active, given the incandescent and molten appearance of the vent's lumen. Thermal readings yield no change in temperature. You are safe here, for now. All that must be done to ensure your continuity as a living, breathing, and active member of the mission is to <color=#FF6A00>NOT DESCEND FURTHER OVER THE ACTIVE VOLCANIC VENT.</color> On the assumption that your vessel contains a cockpit, also ensure that the atmosphere is NOT purely oxygen - any material of high flammability in a pure oxygen atmosphere will likely spontaneously ignite under temperatures that exceed its maximum operating temperature.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh1 = The sole moon of a cold desert world <color=#000000>[Einstein-Rosen bridges do not count, if it was not already obvious]</color> around a Kerbol analog is a rather unremarkable place from an afar viewer, though closer inspection may reveal more. Unless the encounter leading you to its sphere of influence was unintentional or occurred due to anomalous data <color=#000000>[read: SOI glitches]</color>, mind gravitating closer to further scrutinize Dipuc?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh2 = Dipuc's distant appearance resembles lumpy dough, a peanut... or a pallid cherry pit. Perhaps the Kraken could do with a snack for momentary appeasement, or a poison to cull it off for everyone's benefit. Its parent, Sera, will likely pay little attention anyways. Whether or not experimenting with, on, and around the miniature moon is scientifically viable depends on your discretion, intrepid Kerbal.\n\n\nWhat, you think a probe can reach this far without guaranteeing total loss of contact?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh3 = Though already a fair distance from Kcalbeloh, its distinctive accretion disc and event horizon are very visible even with fairly myopic eyes. It would probably do better to explore that area than here... unless you came here first from the nearby wormhole and want to not expend several thousands upon millions of tons of fuel's worth of delta-v.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh4 = A wonderfully pockmarked place, Dipuc. Though it appears to have structures at the lower latitudes resembling skin pimples with the elevated area and a reddish central peak.\n\nOh, those are volcanic cones? Considering their deeper red appearance, the lava contained within them appear... cold. Perhaps Dipuc was once more geologically active and violent? I spot darker areas that resemble the Munar maria, some of them in those larger craters as well. Guess this world might have been more exciting in the past compared to today, who knows?

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Lowlands = May I ask exactly WHY did you run a barometer scan in a VACUUM world of all places? If it did not enter an irreparable and inoperable state until subsequent repair already owing to its entry into a vacuum environment, you attempting to gather data from it surely will from a logical sense.\n\n\n<color=#000000>[I wonder if a mod such as Kerbalism could implement a similar mechanic...]</color>
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Midlands = Either you are asinine for a Kerbal - an already low standard - or you are running the experiment on a single-stage-to-everywhere or multipurpose landing vessel. If it is the latter case, continue onwards and reap your rewards for your efforts, which are admittedly few under the assumption that you arrived in the Kcalbeloh system via gravitationally anomalous wormholes.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Highlands = If you are performing this specifically to earn additional science points, go ahead, but please do note the logical farce of running an atmosphere-dependent scientific experiment in a vacuum environment.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Mountains = Why must you run a barometer scan, which requires residing in an atmosphere to procure any result, in a vacuum environment? Did Gene put you up to this, or is this of your own accord? Regardless, unless you are running this as part of an action group on a multipurpose lander or a single-stage-to-anywhere, I recommend you not run this experiment in this specific environment type again.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Poles = Did you expect lower pressures here given its polar nature? You would only find it in atmospheric conditions, which Dipuc WHOLLY LACKS. For the love of the Kraken, please run this in apt environments. Even thinly atmospheric worlds are better off with this experiment running within their thin gaseous envelope than in here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterSouth = Pardon your rather pedantic round of science experiment-procuring, but have you considered ceasing your current activities to ponder exactly WHY WOULD YOU RUN A BAROMETER SCAN IN A VACUUM? If you have fellow crew members onboard your vessel, I hope you are prepared for derision for this.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterEast = "Why exactly are you running a barometer scan on Dipuc, a diminutive natural satellite that lacks any semblance of atmosphere? Mortimer, contact the Kerbonaut Center, we will need a psychoanalyst for when the current Dipuc surface excursion mission crew return, we have another case of nonsensical science experimentation." -Gene
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_CraterWest = "I have become Ignoramus, ravager of intellect. All genuises cower before me and grovel at my feet!" said the one odd Kerbal while attempting in vain to run a barometer on Dipuc. Gene, for his part, wished to intermittently cut radio communication links with the mission crew owing to his vexation. However, he could not, owing to the fact that constant awareness and data transmission were paramount to ensuring the accomplishment of mission objectives and the misison crew's safety in case of crewed missions like the one he was currently stuck presiding over.\n\nGene, however, received nil comfort from such knowledge, knowing that the Kerbal who attempted in-vacuum barometry gave themselves a reason to anticipate befalling to natural selection.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_DoubleCrater = "By attempting to perform an in-situ barometer experiment in an environment contrary to the expected conditions barometries are oft performed in, you have certified yourself as a professional dunderhead and shall now be on probation until the mission's conclusion. Do not resist your sentencing - it will only aggravate the severity and extend the duration of your probation. Further noncompliance will result in immediate termination via direct vacuum exposure." -Mortimer\n\nThe Kerbal Space Center Kerbonaut Complex will not mind your loss; after all, Kerbonauts must be Kerbalkind's pinnacle in order to successfully traverse the Kraken-infested cosmos.\n\nNeither would Mission Control mind your loss if you happen to be the sole crew member in your current mission.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_Volcano = Is thermometry not a more apt experiment to execute in the proximity of a volcano, more so in an atmospheric environment? Even with volcanic outgassing, the pressure of the released gases would read a practically vacuum environment, much like the rest of this otherwise internally static and atmospherically void world.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded_VolcanoVent = Your valor in the face of potentially imminent death amidst a precarious situation such as this is admirable, almost audacious and careless. If the data from this barometry taken directly within Dipuc's volcanic vents is retrieved by Mission Control via International Deep Space Network transmissions, let it be known that [Lorem Ipsum] Kerman was a courageous Kerbonaut till their molten end.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = "Ahh, yes, a barometer scan. In a vacuum. How sagacious of you. Wait, this mission is uncrewed? Who among the VAB engineers surmised that appending a barometer to the probe was a viable notion?" -Gene
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = ...\n\n...\n\n...Why?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = Have you not already executed this experiment several times in a vacuum environment prior to meandering your way here? First in high Sera orbit, then in high Dipuc orbit, and now in low Dipuc orbit. Where are you planning to perform another barometer scan next, Dipuc's atmosphere-less surface?\n\n...Please do not say "been there, done that."
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = Results from your barometer scan indicate an atmospheric pressure readout of [0] kilopascals (kPa), [null] millimeters of mercury, and [void] bar. Hence, we can conclude on the high probability that this barometer is being utilized in a vacuum environment. To reward your ingenious cretinism, you may claim the shards of congealed mercury whose high-speed ejection from the current containment vessel in shrapnel-like shard is imminent. Please remain aware of your surroundings, and if conducting the barometry in an extravehicular activity, to also immediately and thoroughly inspect your suit for anomalous features. Thank you for your time, and remember:\n\nSic itur ad astra!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = Your stark stupidity for running a barometer scan in a vacuum locale warrants laudation and rewards in the form of a (mandatory) invitation to Bop upon misison conclusion for an exclusive interview with the Kraken! We look forward to your return to Kerbin in sufficient well-being in anticipation!\n\n\n<color=#000000>[Any attempts at resisting the Bop-based Kraken interview will elicit a vicious Kraken attack in the midst of your next participating mission.]</color>
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = A barometer scan is wholly superfluous in this environment. Unless the barometer's current locale is a multipurpose craft intended to venture to multiple celestials sides Dipuc, I recommend you not utilize the barometer once more.\n\nUnless you are performing this for additional science points, in which case, go ahead and take advantage of the technicalities.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = "I do hope you are performing this for the science points and nothing more. Otherwise the Kraken may attempt to locate and consume you on behalf of your fellow Kerbals back home." -excerpt from Mortimer
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = Sera's diminutive dough ball companion will not rise in this environment, especially given the lack of evidence for fermenting lifeforms and more importantly, AN ATMOSPHERE. So it is best to cease the external barometry in pursuit of adequate dough rising conditions and instead conduct an interior barometry to monitor minor fluctuations in the internal atmosphere...assuming the barometer lies on a crewed vessel with one or more interior compartments.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Dipuc_SrfLanded = The Goo appears to feel threatened by the volcanic moon's distant rumbling, and is trembling inside its container. What a wimp.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = A volcano erupts far below in sight of the Goo, and it recoils in fear.

Unfortunately, you will have to give it to the scientists when you get home, so it's best to enjoy it while you can.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Dipuc_SrfLandedVolcanoVent = WOW! HOT POTATO! HOT POTATO!!!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Dipuc_InSpace = The materials don't react to space near Dipuc any differently than they would to space anywhere else. Space is space.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded = At this distance from Sunorc, Dipuc is actually rather cold.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Dipuc_SrfLandedVolcano = The sloping sides of this volcano do not seem to be any hotter than the rest of Dipuc.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Dipuc_SrfLandedVolcanoVent = Ouch. That mildly stings.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Dipuc_InSpace = Despite the volcanic nature of the dough ball below, the thermometer does not appear aware of just how hot it can get down there.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded = Low-frequency rumbling consistent with nearby volcanic activity remains a constant everywhere on Dipuc, a clear sign of how active the moon is.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = Dipuc's weak gravity is fairly uniform at this distance, but there are still tiny blips in the data.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Simeht_InSpaceLow = Closer to Simeht, you can take a much more accurate reading of its gravitational forces.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Simeht_InSpaceHigh = The gravity sensor is thrown off by the proximity of another similarly-sized ice giant, and points towards the barycenter of the system.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Simeht_InSpaceLow = Now that you are closer to Simeht, you can take a much more accurate reading of its very strong magnetic field.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Simeht_InSpaceHigh = The boom senses a strong magnetic field, but Simetra's proximity makes it hard to tell if it is from just Simeht or from both ice giants.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Simeht_FlyingLow = The extreme pressures have pancaked the atmospheric analyzer, but not before it detects the presence of supercritical fluids.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Simeht_FlyingHigh = Simeht's upper atmosphere contains compounds not recognized by the atmospheric analyzer.
            
        // Noira
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noira_SrfLanded = The landscape outside reminds you a lot of footage from the first Mun landings. Of course, there are two very, very big differences in the sky.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noira_InSpaceLow = This feels old hat at this point, to be honest. Let's get down there!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noira_InSpaceHigh = It seems even here, in this bizarre system, familiar sights still exist. Noira could almost be mistaken for the Mun!
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noira_SrfLanded = That's one small step... What? Too played-out?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noira_InSpaceLow = The cratered surface passing by below you makes you feel nostalgic.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noira_InSpaceHigh = Huh? What's the Mun doing here? ...Oh, right. That's physically impossible.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noira_SrfLanded = The Mystery Goo, apparently deciding to dig in its proverbial heels, has become convinced we've landed on a film set on the Mun.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noira_InSpaceLow = The Goo is not sure where it is right now.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noira_InSpaceHigh = The Goo appears to think a trick is being played on it.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Noira_SrfLanded = Basaltic rocks and breccia, huh? How retro of you, Noira. 
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Noira_SrfLanded = The sample bay appears to have become coated in a fine layer of dust from Noira's surface. That's familiar.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Noira_InSpace = As always, space near Noira does not seem to affect the materials differently from space anywhere else.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noira_SrfLanded = Noira's surface temperature is quite frigid compared to the Mun, which makes sense. Out here, it's got to be getting less than 8% of the light Kerbin gets!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noira_InSpace = It says, "Lol". Or maybe that's "101"...?
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noira_SrfLanded = Perhaps it's pointless, but just to be sure, you check the barometer. It's a hard vacuum, alright.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noira_InSpace = Twenty times eight, that would be... six, roughly... seven.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Noira_SrfLanded = Frequent tremors point toward Noira being a moon wracked by tidal forces as the two nearby planets dance about.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noira_SrfLanded = Gravity readings from Noira are reduced periodically as the twin worlds spiral above.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noira_InSpaceLow = Noira's gravity is pretty low, so Simetra and Simeht still make up a large part of the reading.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noira_InSpaceHigh = At this altitude, Noira's pull is hard to distinguish from Simetra and Simeht.
        // Norihc
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Norihc_SrfLanded = Looks cold enough out there to freeze a snowkerb solid.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Norihc_Flying = There really isn't much atmosphere here. This is less like flying, and more like falling... with style!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Norihc_InSpaceLow = Norihc is pretty... COOL! Eh? Eh? Anyone?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = It almost looks like a big snowball. Or maybe... a snowcone? Mmmm... Nitrogen flavor...
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Norihc_SrfLanded = The icy surface reflects the dim sunlight like it's made of crystal. Which, well, ice -is- a kind of crystal, so...
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Norihc_Flying = Normally this would be a horrendous idea, but Norihc's thin atmosphere has reduced it to just a terrible one.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Norihc_InSpaceLow = It sorta reminds you of a shinier version of Eeloo. The cracks criss-crossing Norihc's surface are quite pretty.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = "So uh, Mission Control, remind me again... -how- do you pronounce that name? Er, roger that..."
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Norihc_SrfLanded = The Goo is shivering. It does not appear very fond of the cold.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Norihc_Flying = The Goo forces its capsule shut again, blubbering out angry glorps of protest.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Norihc_InSpaceLow = The Goo is beginning to regret signing up for the space program.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = You probe the Goo for a response, but it's too preoccupied with watching Simetra and Simeht orbiting each other.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Norihc_SrfLanded = This sample is mostly water ice, with traces of darker, redder tholin compounds.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Norihc_SrfLandedLowlands = You find a nice reddish-gray sample, and bring it in for analysis. Apparently it's mostly made of water ice-encrusted tholin compounds, organic matter formed by exposing simple carbon compounds to solar radiation. Neat.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Norihc_SrfLanded = The materials react as expected to the lower pressures, but few substantial chemical reactions take place besides those 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Norihc_Flying = The low pressure wind does little to blow the looser samples around, but some of them still fly about thanks to the depressurization.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Norihc_InSpace = This again. Will it ever stop?
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Norihc_SrfLanded = Norihc is actually not quite as cold as you might expect an ice world to be. It seems that the Simetra-Simeht system receives more sunlight than Jool does, so an ice moon is gonna be a fair bit warmer.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Norihc_Flying = Darn, that's cold. Maybe not as cold as the chilliest ice worlds, but pretty darn cold.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Norihc_InSpace = Two things are infinite: The universe, and Kerbal stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Norihc_SrfLanded = On the surface, pressure is quite a lot higher. It's about a third the pressure of Duna however, so it's sill pretty low.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Norihc_Flying = The instrument takes a bit to register a value, thanks to the extremely low pressure. It thought you were trying to use it in space again.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Norihc_InSpace = The barometer is going on strike due to poor working conditions.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Norihc_SrfLanded = The seismometer registers a number of minor quakes, with activity reaching a peak whenever a planet is passing directly overhead.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Norihc_SrfLanded = Gravity readings are reduced somewhat when Simetra or Simeht pass over, hinting at the effect of tidal forces on Norihc's geology.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Norihc_InSpace = The presence of numerous massive bodies in the vicinity creates quite a complex gravioli environment for the detector to study.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Norihc = Norihc's thin atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen, with traces of carbon monoxide and other gases.
                
        // Noyreg
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noyreg_SrfLanded = The kerbonauts inside are so eager to leave the spacecraft and explore the new green world before them, that Mission Control has to remind them about the horrifically toxic atmosphere and extreme pressure. Begrudgingly, they put on their helmets.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noyreg_FlyingLow = The craft is buffeted by extreme winds, which threaten to steer it off course and into some nearby cliff.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noyreg_FlyingHigh = A mysterious yellowish substance condenses on the windows, reminding the crew of just how inhospitable Noyreg is, despite its friendly color.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = "Can we land here?" The kerbonaut seems blissfully unaware of the toxic nature of the moon below, prompting Mission Control to gently remind them.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noyreg_InSpaceHigh = A green planet with an actual surface? Have we finally found our new home? Oh, 4.5 atmospheres of pressure huh? Yeah... Maybe not.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Temperatures vary dramatically across the moon, ranging from cold enough to freeze water to hot enough to boil it, depending on the weather conditions.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noyreg_SrfLandedIceCaps = The ice caps are spared most of Noyreg's tumult, experiencing consistently freezing temperatures and comparatively sedate wind speeds.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noyreg_FlyingLow = Noyreg's turbulent lower atmosphere contains warring fronts of hot and cold atmosphere, blasting into each other at high speed and inducing extreme winds despite the highly dense composition.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noyreg_FlyingHigh = At such high altitudes, the highly contrasting temperatures even out and Noyreg becomes almost peaceful.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noyreg_InSpace = Do you know the definition of insanity?
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Oh, that's a lot more... orange than you expected. What kind of interesting composition could be responsible for this? Iron oxide, maybe? Or perhaps something more exotic?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noyreg_FlyingLow = Uh oh. This won't end well.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noyreg_FlyingHigh = THIS IS THE GREATEST PLAN.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = Surely it can't be -that- bad down there, right? I mean, it's green!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noyreg_InSpaceHigh = It reminds you of Jool, but much smaller and probably- hopefully- less murder-y.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noyreg_SrfLanded = The mystery Goo does not appear bothered by the toxic atmosphere or extreme temperatures. It only seems to mind the wind.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noyreg_Flying = The Goo is rather fond of Noyreg's color, but would really rather not be exposed to the inclement weather.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noyreg_InSpace = The Goo 'looks' out of its container at the moon below with interest.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Noyreg's crumbly orange surface appears to be extremely rich in organic compounds. Like... REALLY freakin' rich. It's lacking in both silicates and metals, implying Noyreg may be composed mostly of carbon! Wow, that's weird!
		    #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Noyreg_SrfLandedIceCaps = This substance appears to be frozen long-chain hydrocarbons, rather than water ice.
		
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SrfLanded = A sample of water begins to form chlorite, indicating the presence of a lot of chlorine dioxide in the atmosphere. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Flying = The strong winds blow the samples around, splattering some of them against the walls of the container.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_InSpace = Sigh... When will you learn?
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Pressure reads about 4.5 atmospheres. That's quite a lot, but Noyreg's sheer distance from Sunorc prevents it from getting too hot even so.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noyreg_FlyingLow = The pressure reading suddenly spikes as a powerful gust blows against the sensor.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noyreg_FlyingHigh = Pressure is a bit higher in the upper atmosphere due to the lower temperatures.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noyreg_InSpace = Once again. This instrument. Is not. Precise enough. To detect. Exospheres! For Kraken's sake, guys!
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Tidal forces from the two massive worlds circling nearby has a noticeable effect on Noyreg's crust, causing seismic activity that corresponds with close approaches of both planets.
		
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = The reading increases slightly whenever Simetra or Simeht pass overhead, showing that Noyreg experiences a lot of tidal forces.
		    #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noyreg_InSpace = Gravity readings fluctuate according to surface features below; which are sadly obscured by the thick cloud cover.
		
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_Noyreg_InSpace = The magnetometer readings revealed intricate patterns and fluctuations, hinting at the presence of magnetic anomalies and underlying geological phenomena. Noyreg, with its treacherous atmosphere and captivating mysteries, stood as a testament to the awe-inspiring wonders of the cosmos.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Noyreg's atmosphere is comprised mostly of carbon dioxide, with minor quantities of nitrogen, chlorine dioxide, and traces of other(often horribly toxic) gases. It's not yet clear whether the chlorine dioxide is to blame for the atmosphere's green color, or if there is a unique refraction effect involved. Maybe a little of column A, a little of column B?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Noyreg_FlyingLow = Analysis shows Noyreg's carbon dioxide atmosphere thickens considerably at these altitudes, and it is where heavier gases like chlorine dioxide are found.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_Noyreg_FlyingHigh = Nitrogen and traces of other gases are found at high altitudes over Noyreg, but the overwhelming majority is carbon dioxide.
            
        // Noi
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noi_SrfLanded = Wait, hold on. We've landed? It's still all black outside!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noi_InSpaceLow = Nnnnnope. Don't see it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Noi_InSpaceHigh = The crew discovers that, if you squint, you can just barely make out an asteroid floating nearby.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noi_SrfLanded = For some reason, you harbor an intense distaste for stealthy rocks.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noi_InSpaceLow = It's a good thing this stealthy rock isn't anywhere near our home. If it was on a collision course, we'd never see it coming!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_Noi_InSpaceHigh = As you look at Noi, you marvel at the simple beauty of its cratered surface. Mission Control kindly informs you that you're not actually looking at Noi, and you suddenly feel very sheepish.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noi_SrfLanded = The Goo is surprised to learn that we're actually on the surface of something, and has to peek out of the container for a solid few seconds to make sure.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noi_InSpaceLow = The Goo is briefly terrified that we've suddenly been warped right next to Kcalbeloh, as it sees a huge black void covering the sky. It takes a bit to calm it down and reassure it that it's just Noi.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_Noi_InSpaceHigh = The mysterious goo is unable to see the nearby asteroid. It may need some help spotting it.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_Noi_SrfLanded = You scoop up a particularly blackened chunk of rock, and decide it would make a great Khristmas gift for your least favorite family member.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Noi_SrfLanded = It's becoming increasingly obvious that these samples react the same in a vacuum, regardless of whether they're on the surface of something or not.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_Noi_InSpace = The materials react in much the same way they did in interplanetary space.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noi_SrfLanded = Scans of Noi's surface reveal that it's pretty darned cold.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Noi_InSpace = Perhaps one of these days, you'll check the temperature in space and it'll actually give you some data. Until then, you'll keep ramming your proverbial head against this wall.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noi_SrfLanded = The barometer is mostly confused why you'd even bother to check it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_Noi_InSpace = Yup. No pressure... Are you surprised? Is anyone?
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_Noi_SrfLanded = Dead silence. It seems that Noi is too small to even get regular impacts.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noi_SrfLanded = Noi's gravity is marginally stronger on the surface than in orbit, but it's still basically nothing. Jumping on EVA here would be a terrible idea.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_Noi_InSpace = The gravity monitor is asleep, and must be woken up to take a reading. Orbital velocity here is really low, and gravity fluctuates wildly from almost none to basically none depending on what part of Noi is below.
            
        // Arlac System
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_AralcSystem_InSpaceHigh = You ponder about the origin of this system. How exactly did two stars come this close together?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_AralcSystem_InSpaceHigh = The instrument detects powerful stellar magnetic fields, but it is likely that this reading is dominated by the much larger Aralc-A. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_AralcSystem_InSpaceHigh = Despite the two massive bodies at the center of this system, the sensor displays a nearly-constant value.

        // Aralc-A
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The sheer brightness of Aralc-A makes you wish you brought window covers. Not that they would do anything about the heat, though.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_AralcA_InSpaceHigh1 = That certainly is one big, bright star. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_AralcA_InSpaceHigh2 = The inside of the capsule would be an oven if it weren't for the radiators... wait, you remembered to bring radiator panels, right?

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_AralcA_InSpaceLow1 = The thermometer has partially melted down.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_AralcA_InSpaceLow2 = Did you really need a thermometer to see how hot it was down here?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_AralcA_InSpaceHigh1 = The thermometer maxes out due to the proximity to this massive star. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_AralcA_InSpacehigh2 = The thermometer has partially melted down.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_AralcA_InSpaceLow = Why did you think that going on EVA this close to such a massive star was a good idea? Why?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = You are nearly blinded by the intense light from the massive star.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mysteryGoo_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The Goo containment unit is glowing hot and thermal expansion has caused the cover to sieze. It would not to be unreasonable to assume that Goo was thoroughly roasted.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The inside of the Mobile Materials Lab has partially melted down.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = The samples are beginning to glow due to the immense heat, and some of them show signs of breaking down.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The extreme temperatures cause the barometer glass to crack.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The sheer mass of the star and your proximity to it nearly overwhelm the instrument.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = The instrument reads a very strong gravitational pull. 
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_AralcA_InSpaceLow = We don't know exactly how powerful Aralc-A's magnetic fields are, but we do know that they were powerful enough to fry the instrument.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = The instrument reads strong magnetic fields, but the readings are not reliable. 

        //Anneheg
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Anneheg_SrfLanded = The inside of the capsule is getting very very toasty. You could cook a snack on the control panel.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Anneheg_SrfSplashed1 = It's a miracle that the craft has not become one with the lava. Yet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Anneheg_SrfSplashed2 = Why in the name of the Kraken did you think that splashing down in lava was a good idea?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Anneheg_InSpaceLow = It's getting hotter and hotter in here. Did you remember to pack enough radiators?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_Anneheg_InSpaceHigh = It's starting to get toasty in here.
            
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Anneheg_SrfLanded = The thermometer readings are off the scale. The coloring on the thermometer has also faded significantly. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_Anneheg_SrfSplashed1 = The thermometer instantly maxes out before melting and becoming one with the lava.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_WH3141B_InSpaceLow2 = In its own way, staring into this thing from this close is just as bad, if not worse than being on a low-orbit EVA around Kcalbeloh.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_WH3141B_InSpaceHigh1 = While cosmically horrifying in similar fashion to Kcalbeloh, the small “hole” in space-time is undeniably peculiar, and somewhat beautiful from this perspective.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = Good thing this craft has a heater on it.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed = The craft gently rocks back and forth in the waves. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_FlyingLow = The craft vibrates as it flies through the atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_FlyingLow_Twilight = Hey, I think I can see my house from here!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_FlyingHigh = Sudden strong winds threaten to push the craft off course. What is going on up here?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow = We've made it to space!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_crewReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceHigh = From this high up, you can clearly see Suluco's three zones: a scorched desert experiencing eternal day, a frozen wilderness experiencing eternal night, and the twilit strip between the two that you call home.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Day = You had heard about how hot Suluco's day side was, but now you are able to experience it for yourself. You feel a strong desire to leave.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Twilight = Ah, twilight zone, sweet twilight zone!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = I know some things are better left unsaid, but it feels like it should be much colder on this side of the planet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_SrfLanded = I don't think we really needed a spacesuit to get here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed = I suppose now is as good a time as any to go for a swim.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_FlyingLow = This is certainly a most precarious situation.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_FlyingHigh = Wheeeeeeeeeee!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow_Day = You take in the view of the perpetual desert beneath you. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow_Twilight = Wow, I never knew just how little area there is for us to inhabit.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow_Night = You take in the views of the frozen lands beneath you.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow_Water = It's actually kind of stunning to know just how little liquid water is on our home planet's surface.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_evaReport_SulucoHome_InSpaceHigh = Our home certainly does look like an eyeball, doesn't it?

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Day = The soil here is coarse and very dry, likely due to this side of the planet receiving a perpetual sunbath.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Twilight = The soil here is rather moist, likely due to snowmelt from the night side of the planet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = The soil here is frozen, probably due to not receiving much in the way of heat. I can see why no one has attempted to farm here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_SulucoHome_SrfLanded = You take a sample of Suluco's soil for analysis.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_surfaceSample_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed = It's water. What else did you expect?

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Day = Many of the samples have broken down due to the constant sunbath. There is also evidence of a small fire inside the materials bay.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Twilight = The samples have yet to show any significant changes.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = The samples have ice crystals growing inside them.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed = Many of the samples show signs of corrosion as a result of exposure to water. Strangely, one of the samples also appears charred.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SulucoHome_Flying = The less resilient samples deposited themselves across the interior of the unit. I do not envy whoever has to clean that up.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SulucoHome_InSpace = Some of the samples appear to have broken free, and are now floating around inside the materials bay.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Day = It's very warm out here. You would need to be crazy to want to live here!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_DayPole = This is the hottest part of the planet, and OH BOY, it is toasty here! No wonder we haven't settled in this area of the planet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Twilight = The temperature here is just right. Now I understand why we live in this part of the planet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = The temperature on this half of the planet is almost unbearably cold.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_NightPole = This is the coldest part of the planet, and it seems like the thermometer has frozen. Needless to say, it's obvious why no one lives here.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed_Water = The water temperature is actually pleasant here. Seems like one could reasonably go for a swim.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed_ColdOcean = The thermometer shatters upon touching the frigid waters. Good thing we have a warranty for it, right? Whaddya mean "it's void"??
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_FlyingLow = Convection currents through the atmosphere create significant temperature fluctuations as you pass through different altitudes.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_FlyingLow_Day = Temperatures above the day zone are slightly cooler than on the surface, but not by much. Warm updrafts make the air warmer than it might otherwise be.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_FlyingLow_Night = Cold downdrafts result in the local atmospheric temperature being much lower than it would be otherwise.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_SulucoHome_FlyingHigh = Temperatures in the high atmosphere are more uniform, but there is still evidence of convection through the atmosphere.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Day = The presence of a low-pressure zone on the day side leads us to believe that air gets heated by sunlight here, then carried towards colder regions via upper atmospheric currents.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Twilight = There is a very persistent wind between the day and night side of the planet. More research must be conducted into how these winds form.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = The pressence of a high-pressure zone on the night side gives us a more complete picture of Suluco's atmospheric currents. Air gets heated on the day side, then flows to the night side via convention currents, where it cools and flows back to the day side, leading to the persistent winds.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed = Water has flooded the barometer, rendering it unusable.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_FlyingLow = Fluctuations in atmospheric pressure lead us to speculate about the existence of convection currents in the atmosphere, which would likely originate from the temperature gradient between the two halves of the planet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_FlyingHigh = Further fluctuations in atmospheric pressure seem to confirm the existence of atmospheric convection currents.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow = The barometer reads zero! We must be in space!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded = The seismic scanner detects very little seismic activity. Our home is likely geologically very stable.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_SulucoHome_SrfLanded = Having properly calibrated the gravity sensor, you take a reading of the local gravity on Suluco's surface.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_SulucoHome_SrfSplashed = The gravity sensor gets fried upon contact with the water.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_SulucoHome_InSpace_Day = The desert side appears to have a very stable gravitation, suggesting very low variability in geologic composition.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_SulucoHome_InSpace_Twilight = Passing over the twilight zone, the gravity sensor reads a very slight drop in the local gravity readings, suggesting this part of the planet is at a relatively low elevation.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_SulucoHome_InSpace_Night = The gravity sensor's readings fluctuate as it passes over the night side, particularly over the frozen mountaintops.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_SulucoHome_InSpace = You take a reading of the local gravity over Suluco.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Day = Analysis of the atmosphere on Suluco's day side reveals surprisingly high humidity, probably because the warm air can hold a lot of moisture.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Twilight = The air in the twilight zone is moderately humid. Just perfect for living here. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_SrfLanded_Night = Analysis of the atmosphere on Suluco's night side reveals extremely low humidity, likely due to most of the moisture in the air becoming snow.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_FlyingLow = Due to atmospheric currents, the air that the atmospheric analyzer picks up could have originated from a completely different part of the planet.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_FlyingLow_Day = The atmospheric analyzer detects small concentrations of fine soil particles, which were likely pulled up and off the ground by strong updrafts.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_FlyingLow_Night = Droplets of supercooled water freeze on contact with the atmospheric analyzer, blocking its ports.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_SulucoHome_FlyingHigh = The atmospheric composition at high altitudes is far more uniform.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_SulucoHome_InSpace = The magnetometer boom detects a weak, uniform magnetic field around Suluco, which is likely what protects the atmosphere of our home planet and allows us to live here. It is likely that this magnetic field is created by an internal geodynamo.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_EfilHome_SrfLanded_Grassland = Several samples have weeds growing out of them. Did anyone drop seeds in there by chance?
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_EfilHome_SrfLanded_Beach = You open the materials bay to study the samples, only to discover a sand crab rave going on inside it. Unfortunately, it seems that the samples became refreshments. *sigh.*

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_EfilHome_SrfSplashed = The water temperature is nice and chilly. Hey, no! That does not mean you can go for a swim!
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_temperatureScan_EfilHome_InSpace = The thermometer reads zero. Go figure, we're in space.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_EfilHome_SrfLanded = Atmospheric pressure on your homeworld is lower than what you're normally accustomed to, but still well within the range that would be comfortable.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_EfilHome_SrfSplashed = Water enters the barometer's ports, clogging them up and rendering the device unusable.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_barometerScan_EfilHome_InSpace = The barometer reads zero! We must be in space!

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_seismicScan_EfilHome_SrfLanded = The seismometer records information about Efil's seismic activity, giving insight into the internal structure of our home.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_SrfLanded = The gravity sensor reads a way higher value than it should. Looks like it may need to be recalibrated. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_SrfSplashed = The gravity sensor short-circuits as water gets inside.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Water = The gravity sensor detects brief changes in the local gravity over the ocean, likely due to the influence of Anehta and the other moons in the system.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Beach = The gravity sensor reading flattens out as it passes over the beach.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Grassland = The gravity sensor reading flattens as it passes over the equally flat grasslands.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Desert = The gravity sensor flatlines as it passes over the desert. 
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Tundra = The tundra below you causes the gravity sensor to very briefly spike.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Mountains = The gravity sensor follows the terrain of the mountains below, resulting in small but very noticeable changes in the local gravity reading.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_gravityScan_EfilHome_InSpace_Forests = The gravity sensor spits out nonsense. It appears to be unable to handle the sheer amount of vegetation below it.

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded = The instrument does its analysis of Efil's atmosphere.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded_Water = The instrument gets flooded with water and is rendered unusable.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded_TropicalDesert = Despite it being a desert, the air here is unusually humid.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded_ColdDesert = The air here is cold and very dry.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded_Mountains = The air in the mountains is cold and dry due to its elevation. Seems like a fun place to go for a hike.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded_Forests = The atmospheric analyzer doesn't seem to register anything at all. You then see a large bug fly out of one of the ports.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_SrfLanded_Beach = The air here is very humid, probably because we're right next to a large body of water.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_FlyingLow = The lower atmosphere of Efil is still very livable.
            #LOC_KS_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_EfilHome_FlyingHigh = There is very little atmosphere at these altitudes. 

            #LOC_KS_SciDef_magnetometer_EfilHome_InSpace = The magnetometer boom detects a strong, very mildly fluctuating magnetic field, probably due to the influence of nearby Anehta.

        // Kcalbeloh
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Kcalbeloh_SrfLanded = The boom is spaghetti. You're spaghetti. Everything is spaghetti! What is happening?!?! WHY IS THERE SO MUCH PASTA?!?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = At such a distance from Kcalbeloh, there is very little activity to speak of. It's much like interplanetary space, or even interstellar space.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = Radio waves and ionized particles from the accretion disk damage the detectors, causing acute failure in all its systems. It's probably fixable, though... probably.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = Faint radio emissions can be detected originating from the distant Kcalbeloh, but besides Maelg, all the other stars are producing far more activity.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = The intern watching the telescope feed briefly becomes quite excited indeed when he spots the so-called 'singularity'- turns out the intense forces cracked the lens and created a bright spot in the center.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = Kcalbeloh's accretion disk is captured in stunning detail with the instrument, and closer analysis reveals that the edges of the disk are slightly redshifted and blueshifted.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = Although the sensors would theoretically be capable of analyzing the accretion disk from this distance without the light causing damage, they are unable to, on account of being hopelessly warped by the intense forces at play.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = Multispectral analysis confirms that the two ends of the accretion disk are subtly redshifted and blueshifted. The composition of the disk, meanwhile, appears to be largely hydrogen and helium, confirming that it's comprised of mass from at least one star that Kcalbeloh devoured many millions of years ago.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Whilst studying the telemetry, you hear the sounds of... a banjo playing? Then a harmonica, a whistling voice, a drum, a flute, and a piano. It sounds... sentimental, nostalgic even. Then you wake up, and the song is gone. Was it all a dream?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = Kcalbeloh's accretion disk emits intense radio waves constantly, though this instrument isn't anywhere near sensitive enough to detect any Kerman radiation.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = High-energy particles completely fry the active ion concentrator and destroy the passive collectors' sensitive wafers. Way to go, genius.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = The accretion disk's 'holar wind' deposits ionized particles in the collectors, but there are also very faint traces from multiple other directions, likely originating from the Kcalbeloh system's most massive stars.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceLow = Okay. Who's the comedian who added a sensor for detecting water via microwave emissions to the BLACK HOLE mission? I want names!

		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Kcalbeloh_InSpaceHigh = While of course the event horizon itself has an albedo of precisely zero, the accretion disk is emitting light in all recorded wavelengths, much like a star does. However, it's considerably dimmer than most stars.
		
		// Onrefni
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded = Onrefni's surface magnetic field is quite strong, especially for a body so small. Its core is most likely proportionally enormous, and strongly churned up- kneaded, even- by Kcalbeloh's immense gravitational pull.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed = Many have speculated that if we knew why the magnetometer sent the message 'oh no, not again!' as it melted in the lava on a blanet closely orbiting a supermassive black hole, we would know a good deal more about the nature of the universe than we do now.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = Even with a powerful magnetosphere, Onrefni can do little to stop the so-called 'holar wind' from blasting its surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = Kcalbeloh's 'holar wind' blows hard here. You can practically hear it howling, except space doesn't work that way, of course. But the silence arguably makes the whole scene even more unsettling...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLowLava = Rock as black as night is strongly contrasted by bright red-orange streaks of searing lava, flowing through the cracks in Onrefni's surface. One must wonder how much longer it can take this.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLowDay = Deep fissures cover Onrefni's surface, especially on the day side. It looks like some colossal space being punched it and shattered half the surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLowNight = Cracks still run across the dark side of Onrefni, highlighted against Kcalbeloh's brilliantly illuminated accretion disk.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Onrefni_InSpaceLowCraters = The rims of Onrefni's craters glint in the baleful light of the accretion disk. One has to wonder what created these features- did they find their way down close to Kcalbeloh, or did Onrefni get flung here in the past, already carrying these scars?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = What you see before you is the very picture of beauty in desolation. Onrefni is a world on the brink of destruction, and yet despite being an airless little rock with nothing to accompany it but the swirling cosmic hurricane that surrounds it, the blanet's apocalyptic surface is absolutely captivating.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Onrefni_dmImagingPlatform_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = Multispectral analysis indicates no traces of an atmosphere, and a surface dominated by metal-rich silicates. Most likely, that surface is a thin layer atop a blanet that's almost nothing but dense metal core.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Onrefni_dmImagingPlatform_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = Thermal imaging indicates that, despite being tidally locked, Onrefni is scorching on both sides. The day side likely isn't being warmed much by the light anyway; it's Kcalbeloh's gravity that's doing that.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = Onrefni doesn't appear to have changed the radio environment at all; the constant activity from the accretion disk remains unchanged here.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Onrefni_SrfLanded = It's difficult to obtain an accurate reading with all of the neutrons flying every which way, but the surface of Onrefni is coated in hydrogen atoms. This is certainly not water, but rather deposits from the intense 'holar wind' and from direct contact with the accretion disk.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Onrefni_SrfLanded = The surface of Onrefni proves extremely resistant to your attempts to vaporize it with a laser. What little actually vaporizes only confirms the composition is primarily igneous rock, and highly heat-resistant rock at that. That tracks.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Onrefni_SrfLandedLava = So your plan is to melt the lava with a laser? Aight, bet.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed = This is fine. I'm okay with the events that are unfolding currently.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Onrefni_InSpace = The high-energy particles prove just as hazardous to the collector as they were when we weren't near Onrefni.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Onrefni_InSpaceLow = Erm... Yes. Yes, this blanet definitely has subsurface water deposits. Sure...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Onrefni_InSpaceHigh = Due to its dark surface, Onrefni has a very low albedo that reflects very little light in all wavelengths.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Onrefni_SrfLanded = Onrefni resonates very readily, all but confirming the presence of its massively disproportionate metal core.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Onrefni_SrfSplashed = Turn "Ignore Max Temperature" off, you coward!
		
		// Rouqea
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Rouqea_SrfLanded = The boom was evidently not designed for this kind of pressure, and parts of it seem to have crumpled.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Rouqea_SrfSplashed = The magnetic field from Rouqea's surface is a tad stronger than in orbit, but it's still weak. Given its proximity to Kcalbeloh, the tidal forces should be churning up the core. Perhaps it doesn't have a metal core at all?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Rouqea_InSpaceHigh = Black hole wind from Kcalbeloh's accretion disk is producing some interesting interactions with Rouqea's dense atmosphere, but they're not really all that special compared to what we've seen before.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Rouqea_InSpaceLow = Rouqea's thick atmosphere and wet surface produce a lot of fascinating radio wave activity. This is truly an alien world!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Rouqea_InSpaceHigh = Blue, blue.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Rouqea_InSpaceLow = Uhhh. Water. And... there's some water over there, and... Oh, look at that! It's water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Rouqea_InSpaceHigh = Multispectral analysis of Rouqea's atmosphere confirms a majority is nitrogen, but there is also quite a lot of oxygen. That's interesting, could there be life on Rouqea?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Rouqea_InSpaceLow = Examining Rouqea's surface in most spectra does not reveal much below the surface. It seems the water is quite deep.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Rouqea_InSpaceLowHighlands = Analyzing this region of Rouqea's oceans reveals something surprising; in parts the water appears to be as shallow as 100m deep!
		
		//Non-Hellswitch Rouqea Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Rouqea_InSpaceLow = Though Rouqea's turbulent atmosphere and oceans produce plenty of interesting radio activity, there's nothing suggesting an intelligent presence down there.
		
		//Rouqea Hellswitch Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_RouqeaHome_InSpaceLow = Unfortunately, at this altitude the latest headball game is too garbled to enjoy, what with the transmission having to go through so much water and atmosphere to reach space.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Rouqea_SrfSplashed = ...Yes, it's water.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Rouqea_SrfLanded = Unfortunately, the instrument appears to have crumpled under the absurd water pressure. We may never know if Rouqea harbors water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Rouqea_SrfSplashed = Laser analysis confirms the liquid to be water. It seems pretty obvious, but it's always good to check.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Rouqea_SrfLanded = Laser analysis confirms the solid to be... water? Wait, it's water ice? But it's so hot... Is this exotic ice? That's like, my favorite type of ice! Awesome.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Rouqea_InSpaceHigh = 'Holar wind' from Kcalbeloh appears to be all there is at this altitude. No evidence of any Van Kerman radiation belts is detected.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Rouqea_InSpaceLow = Near Rouqea, the collector picks up water vapor in addition to both nitrogen and oxygen- but Kcalbeloh's black hole wind is still strong.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Rouqea_InSpaceLow = Water? Yes!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Rouqea_InSpaceHigh = Though beautiful in the visible spectrum, Rouqea's oceanic surface has a rather low albedo- and its dense atmosphere absorbs most non-visible wavelengths of light.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Rouqea_SrfSplashed = Erm... Splash? You aren't sure what you expected.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Rouqea_SrfLanded = Sadly, even at this depth there isn't much data to be collected, as the sensors are woefully out of their element and also probably floating on the humongous waves above anyway. The local sensors do at least tell you that the immediate surroundings appear to resonate much like exotic ice is expected to.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Rouqea_SrfSplashedGenericShallow = Nothing but water for kilometers in every direction, including down. Scans of the water itself reveal no organic compounds.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Rouqea_SrfSplashedGenericDeep = Even well below the surface, all you can see is water. Despite the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere above, there are no signs of life, even on a microscopic level.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Rouqea_SrfSplashedHighlandsShallow = The scanner actually picks up signs of a solid surface down below! Let's dive deeper!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Rouqea_SrfSplashedHighlandsDeep = You can actually see a solid surface at this depth! Despite this however, all signs point to Rouqea being totally lifeless.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Rouqea_SrfLanded = The drill finds mostly water and traces of other elements, but no signs of biological activity. It's likely that the source of Rouqea's oxygen is geological in nature.
		
		// Iomena
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Iomena_SrfLanded = Iomena has an appreciable surface magnetic field that strongly distorts depending on the location, but even in the quietest parts there remains a constant stream of activity. This is probably a proper magnetic field produced by a geodynamo effect.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Iomena_SrfLandedHighlands = Magnetic activity in this location is actually a little bit weaker here, possibly due to the raised terrain reducing the density of magnetic ores in the crust.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Iomena_SrfLandedMountainsAll = The magnetic field strengthens here, possibly because of magnetized material being brought up to the crust from deep within Iomena.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Iomena_SrfLandedCraters = Isolated regions of intense magnetic activity would suggest the impactor scattered magnetic ores when it landed.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Iomena_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Some magnetic field lines run along the canyon walls, confirming the presence of magnetically active materials.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Iomena_InSpaceLow = This far from Kcalbeloh, the 'holar wind' is noticeably weaker, despite still being pretty close to the accretion disk.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Iomena_InSpaceHigh = The flow of black hole wind from Kcalbeloh's accretion disk is sometimes interrupted by hints of charged particles being blown off of Iomena's thin atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Iomena_InSpaceLowGeneric = Desolate fields of blue-gray rocks have a surprising beauty to them. The view on the surface is probably pretty spectacular, especially with Kcalbeloh in the background.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Iomena_InSpaceLowMountainsAll = Iomena's peaks stand out, as most of them are frosted with some sort of bright substance. It's probably not water ice, though...
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Iomena_InSpaceLowCanyonsAll = These canyons look quite dramatic indeed. But is the atmosphere thick enough to fly through them? We need to find out, right away!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Iomena_InSpaceLowCraters = The frigid shores of Iomena's flooded craters must be breathtaking. Even from space, there's a certain lonely beauty to them.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Iomena_InSpaceLowOceans = Whatever this stuff is, it's probably not water. Conditions should be right for liquid ammonia on the surface, so if we land there, PLEASE remember not to drink any of it.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Iomena_InSpaceHigh = From a distance, Iomena's dim gray features show clear signs of past and present liquid flow on the surface; though this far from Kcalbeloh, it's most likely too cold for liquid water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Iomena_InSpaceLowGeneric = Judging by the multi-spectral analysis, Iomena's blue-gray surface appears to be a fairly standard mix of various silicate minerals and ammonia.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Iomena_InSpaceLowWater = This liquid is just the right temperature to be ammonia, according to the IR readings.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Iomena_InSpaceLowMountainsAll = The IR signature indicates that the bright substance covering Iomena's mountains is probably ammonia ice.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Iomena_InSpaceHigh = Iomena's thin atmosphere contains mostly ammonia, though the readings suggest traces of methane and carbon dioxide. These traces could be a biosignature- that warrants further study!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Iomena_InSpaceLow = The only radio activity here besides Kcalbeloh's 'holar wind' is being produced by interactions between it and Iomena's thin atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Iomena_SrfLanded = Iomena's surface is universally saturated with hydrogen; however, the vast majority of it is unlikely to be water. It's more probable that it's ammonia, and potentially some organic compounds.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Iomena_SrfLandedGeneric = Scans of the plume created by vaporizing the surface indicate several iron-rich silicates, all heavily saturated with ammonia.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Iomena_SrfLandedOceans = This wet soil has been soaked with liquid ammonia, according to our analysis. There are also some simple hydrocarbons embedded in the soil.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Iomena_SrfSplashed = Blasting the liquid confirms the near-total lack of water; instead, only ammonia and short-chain hydrocarbons are detected.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Iomena_SrfLandedMountainsAll = The bright white substance covering this mountain peak appears to be ammonia ice.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Iomena_SrfLandedCanyonsAll = Iron-rich rocks are found here, possibly having fallen from the canyon walls.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Iomena_SrfLandedLowlands = Iomena's low-lying regions probably gather the densest, most iron-rich rocks over time. This would help to explain the very high iron content in the ground here.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Iomena_InSpaceLow = Traces of ammonia become embedded in the collectors, but besides that there isn't much else here. Even the 'holar wind' has disappeared.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Iomena_InSpaceHigh = 'Holar wind' from Kcalbeloh is already a fair bit weaker at this distance, since even with its immense size, it doesn't output as much as most stars do. 
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Iomena_InSpaceLow = Low microwave emissions help to corroborate the hypothesis that Iomena's surface is dominated by ammonia, not water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Iomena_InSpaceHigh = Iomena's mostly gray surface produces an overall low albedo, and its atmosphere absorbs most visible wavelengths in a pattern indicating large quantities of ammonia gas.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Iomena_SrfLandedRocky = The rock here resonates well, giving the sensors a clear picture of Iomena's interior structure. There are some large underground caverns, which are probably eroded by liquid ammonia flows- and most of the crust appears to be rocky in composition. There's surprisingly little water ice.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Iomena_SrfLandedWet = The damp(with liquid ammonia), soft soil here is not especially good at transmitting seismic waves. So... What, you took this hammer and immediately sought out the softest soil you could find? Just go somewhere else, Iomena is pretty rocky.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Iomena_SrfSplashedOceansShallow = The liquid is definitely ammonia, but there's also a fair concentration of some complex organic molecules. These could have a number of potential origins- but one of those is indeed biological in nature. We should go deeper!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Iomena_SrfSplashedOceansDeep = The camera shows a hydrothermal vent... or... whatever you'd call those in ammonia. Anyway, it's pumping out black smoke, indicating some level of present volcanic activity on Iomena. The real discovery is in the ammonia sample- new hydrocarbons continue to form, and a microscope reveals tiny organisms metabolizing the contents of the smoke plume!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Iomena_SrfSplashedCraterLakesShallow = Complex organic molecules float on the ammonia lake and suggest the potential existence of life on Iomena, despite the cold and the toxic environment. If something does live here, it would likely find our home far too hot.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Iomena_SrfSplashedCraterLakesDeep = The deepest part of this lake reveals ongoing formation of hydrocarbons in the deepest, warmest region of the planet. Sulfur and phosphorus compounds are also drifting through the water, implying limited volcanic activity elsewhere. A closer look with a microscope confirms our suspicions- microorganisms are indeed utilizing the volatiles, and converting them into hydrocarbons!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Iomena_SrfLandedRocky = The rock here contains traces of organic matter, but there are no other signs of biological activity.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Iomena_SrfLandedWet = A substantial concentration of organic molecules and volatile elements- primarily sulfur and phosphorus- are detected in this core sample.
		
		// Uleg
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = Even on its surface, Uleg's magnetic field is vanishingly weak.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = No magnetic field is detected at this altitude. It's probable that Uleg lacks an iron-nickel core, as its extreme orbit should cause it to experience significant tidal forces.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Uleg_InSpace = The radio plasma environment varies dramatically depending on Uleg's position in its orbit. Near apobeloh, it's very quiet. But at peribeloh, the 'holar wind' from Kcalbeloh can be felt; if only just barely.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Uleg_InSpaceLowGeneric = The pockmarked surface of Uleg reminds one of cookies-and-cream ice cream just a little bit too much. When the public lays eyes on these photos, they're gonna be salivating.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Uleg_InSpaceLowCrater = Now that's one heck of a crater. It's so eroded though, that it took a bit to actually identify it as such.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Uleg_InSpaceLowRiftValleys = This massive canyon stretches across Uleg's surface, forming a giant circuit going all the way up to the north pole. It would make for a phenomenal air race course, if it wasn't for the extremely thin atmosphere. Curse you, fate! Well... Maybe for the REAL daredevils, it would still work. There's also the possibility of ground races!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Uleg_InSpaceLowBasins = The wide, open basin appears to have very flat terrain. It could be a good spot for building a base, if that strikes your fancy. But with Uleg's absurd orbit, there are probably better places for it. 
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Uleg_InSpaceLowMountains = Tiny mountains dot Uleg's surface like crumbs of chocolate cookie in a vast ocean of vanilla ice cream. Darn it, now you're hungry again!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = This dim blanet seems to shimmer in the darkness like a scoop of irresistible dessert. It's practically begging you to get closer...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Uleg_InSpaceLow = Surface analysis indicates that Uleg's surface is primarily composed of water ice.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Uleg_InSpaceLowMountains = Data from images of Uleg's darker mountains show that the surface is still water ice. It's likely that a different crystalline structure accounts for its darker color.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = Uleg's thin atmosphere appears to be primarily composed of nitrogen according to broad spectrum analysis, with significant quantities of methane and carbon dioxide as well.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Uleg_InSpaceLow = Uleg's thin, calm atmosphere and distance from Kcalbeloh result in a rather uninteresting radio environment.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The clear, low-energy neutron signal confirms that the majority of Uleg's surface is made of water ice. Frosty!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Uleg_SrfLandedGeneric = Chemical analysis of Uleg's icy surface shows that most of the blanet is covered in a thin layer of hard, brittle water ice, with much more solid, darker ice beneath. There are also traces of methane ice and carbon dioxide ice in this surface coating. It may have been deposited here by the frigid winds.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Uleg_SrfLandedMountainsCliffs = This region of Uleg has a darker coloration than the rest, but the analysis shows the chemical composition is still mostly water ice, likely of a different crystalline structure than the thin layer covering the rest of the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Uleg_InSpace = So far from Kcalbeloh, the 'holar wind' is very sparse- and it gets even more so when Uleg is high in its orbit. This means that there's not much for the collector to process besides trace nitrogen particles, probably from Uleg's atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Uleg_InSpaceLow = Uleg is primarily comprised of water according to the microwave emissions, which are very strong regardless of which region of Uleg is currently below.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Uleg_InSpaceHigh = Uleg's surface has a pretty high albedo all over in the visible and IR spectra, however, it appears to strongly absorb UV light. This indicates large quantities of water ice on the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Uleg_SrfLanded = The brittle, icy surface cracks easily as the hammer impacts it, but the waves still travel fairly well. The readings indicate active cryovolcanism throughout Uleg.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Uleg_SrfLanded = The core sample is full of ice, methane, and a bit of carbon dioxide, but not much else. It's unlikely that the methane is biological in origin.
		
		// Maelg
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Maelg_InSpaceLow = Despite the fact that Maelg is fusing deuterium and lithium, it doesn't seem to be escaping the object- or at least, not in significant quantities.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = Being a brown dwarf, Maelg does not really do solar wind. However, the magnetic activity does produce some interesting readings.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Maelg_InSpaceLow = For not being a star(technically), Maelg is pretty bright from this distance. Luckily, the telescope came with filters. It captures high-resolution images of Maelg's raging orange storms; like some kind of insane version of Jool made of fire!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = The telescope is easily able to focus on Maelg without damage thanks to its very low luminosity, allowing it to capture highly detailed pictures of the substellar object.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Maelg_InSpace = Spectral analysis of Maelg corroborates the earlier classification as an L-type object, and shows clear evidence of deuterium and lithium being fused into helium-3 and helium-4, respectively. 
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Maelg_InSpaceLow = A veritable blast of radio emissions is emitting from Maelg at all times, as its interior churns and flows violently.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Maelg_InSpaceLow = Several isotopes of helium are deposited in the collectors, but nowhere near as much as one would receive from a true star.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = As an L-type brown dwarf, Maelg's fusion of deuterium and lithium does not produce detectable solar wind, and the collectors remain empty.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Maelg_InSpaceLow = Powerful microwave emissions are detected, but it's impossible that these originate from water deposits, as Maelg is a BROWN DWARF. In case you forgot. Not a planet, or a star.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Maelg_InSpaceHigh = Maelg emits comparatively little light in the visible spectra, but is much more visible in the IR range. Either way though, at this distance it's not hard to see.
		
		// Mehtna
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = Mehtna's magnetic field remains weak, albeit easily detectable, from the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Mehtna_InSpace = Since Mehtna's atmosphere is quite calm, the planet lacks a strong magnetic field, and Maelg does not output significant solar wind, there's barely any activity here to detect.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLowDay = Several interesting features are present in Mehtna's dark brown 'iris', forming unique patterns.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLowIce = Beautifully intricate cracks run across the surface of Mehtna in the lit regions, producing mesmerizing photos.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLowNight = Hmm... Yeah, that sure is dark, alright.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Mehtna_InSpaceLowGrandCrater = The mostly craterless surface of Mehtna makes this huge one quite the striking feature!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = Mehtna's "warm pole" makes it truly look like an eyeball, always staring directly at Maelg. It's kinda creepy, actually.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Mehtna_InSpaceLowDayGrandCrater = Multispectral scans of the darker surface of Mehtna indicate a mostly standard surface of silicates.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Mehtna_InSpaceLowIce = The white substance appears to be water ice, as predicted by our earlier analysis of the planet's temperature and atmosphere. No liquid is present because its low pressure causes water to sublimate directly into gas.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Mehtna_InSpaceLowNight = IR scans show a desolate surface at Mehtna's "cold pole", covered in craters and mostly lacking in the cracks seen on the visible side.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = Spectral analysis reveals that Mehtna's atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide and water vapor- the latter is likely produced by ice being sublimated on the day side.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = Hmm... Nothing but radio silence coming from Mehtna, sadly.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Mehtna_SrfLandedRock = Mehtna's darker areas are, perhaps rather unexpectedly, mostly devoid of water deposits. This is probably because in these temperatures and pressures, water sublimates directly to gas instead of becoming a liquid.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Mehtna_SrfLandedIce = The frozen surface here produces a strong low-energy neutron signal, confirming it to be water ice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Mehtna_SrfLandedRock = Laser analysis says more silicates. Yay! That's not boring at all! Not at all...
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Mehtna_SrfLandedIce = Everything about Mehtna's properties, from its temperature to its atmosphere, says this could only be water ice. I'll let you guess what the chemical analysis shows.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Mehtna_InSpace = Space near Mehtna is very empty, as it was in orbit of Maelg. But near the planet, there are some traces of carbon dioxide.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Mehtna_InSpaceLow = Microwave emissions make it obvious that much of Mehtna is covered by water ice, though even over the drier sun-facing(dwarf-facing?) areas, a constant background remains. This would be neatly explained by water vapor in the atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Mehtna_InSpaceHigh = Mehtna's large dark spot and UV-absorbing signature confirm it to be covered in water ice, and the spectra in its atmosphere suggest a majority composition of carbon dioxide and water vapor.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Mehtna_SrfLanded = Subsurface reflections show little evidence of geological activity on Mehtna.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Mehtna_SrfLanded = The core sample remains disappointingly, but expectedly, inert.
		
		// Meiuqer
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded = You check the magnetometer as a matter of principle. Nothing, not even localized magnetic fields generated by metal deposits.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Meiuqer_InSpace = In this particular little corner of space, there is almost precisely nothing for the RPWS instrument to detect. Almost no radio activity, no solar plasma, nothing. But you check it anyway. Just in case.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Meiuqer_InSpaceLow = Oh, this is actually a rather lovely little rock. Swirly and brown, it reminds one of a donut hole covered with brown sugar.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Meiuqer_InSpaceHigh = Mmmm.... Space taters...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Meiuqer_InSpace = It's a rock! I know it's a rock! Don't you think I know a rock when I see a rock? I spend a lot of time staring at pictures of rocks!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Meiuqer_InSpaceLow = Rocks don't emit radio signals, dummy.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded = You know, when I signed up to oversee space missions, I was expecting I'd get to see lots of explosions. Not stare at boring telemetry all day.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Meiuqer_SrfLanded = im on ur rokc, lazrin ur rocks.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Meiuqer_InSpace = For a moment, you could've sworn the solar particle collector was snoring.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Meiuqer_InSpaceLow = No microwave readings, except the readings from the microwave oven back at the space center- the intern monitoring the feed is heating up some spicy noodles.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Meiuqer_InSpaceHigh = Meiuqer has a very low albedo owing to its dark surface, a fact worsened by the extreme dimness of the light coming from Maelg.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Meiuqer_SrfLanded = As a low-density 'rubble pile' asteroid, Meiuqer is held together very loosely- and some of the debris from the impact have no doubt reached escape velocity. This also means you got no useful data.

		// Sunorc
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = The boom seems to be having trouble maintaining structural integrity, as it is currently being converted into a liquid.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = Numerous sunspots are detected by the instrument as it analyzes the radio waves emitting from Sunorc's surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Sunorc_InSpaceHigh = This K-type star emits powerful solar winds, as most stars are wont to do. Interactions with Sedah's magnetosphere are notable, as radio waves emitting from the planet are weaker than expected for an object its size.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = Well, this was a waste of money. You may have just ruined the orbital telescope.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sunorc_InSpaceHigh = You maniac! Are you trying to destroy the telescope? This device is designed for planetary photography!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = You have voided the warranty.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sunorc_InSpaceHigh = Well, that was a bad idea. The sensitive instruments automatically shut down the moment they were trained on Sunorc, and may have been damaged.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = Like most stars, Sunorc emits radio waves in a wide spectrum. Spikes in radio activity appear to correlate with the formation and movement of sunspots.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = The overwhelming density of the solar wind forces the device to shut down, preventing any useful data from being collected. Hopefully it's not damaged.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Sunorc_InSpaceHigh = Sunorc's solar wind is typical for a star, though it is a tad weaker than a G-type star like Kerbol.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Sunorc_InSpaceLow = Perhaps it would be best not to deploy sensitive equipment for sensing microwave emissions in low stellar orbit. Mayhaps. Perchance.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Sunorc_InSpaceHigh = Sunorc emits a lot of light in most recorded wavelengths, however, as a K-type star(or orange dwarf) it outputs considerably less blue and UV light than a G-type star(or yellow dwarf) like Kerbol. Because of its lower temperature, these types of stars can live billions of years longer than yellow dwarfs.
	
		// Sedah
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Sedah_InSpaceLow = Solar wind buffets Sedah's puffy atmosphere hard, producing strange signals from within the planet. This suggests an electric current runs through the planet, which would produce a lot of internal heat and help to explain its sheer size. It must not be as powerful as expected however, as this current only produces a magnetic field that, while powerful, is a bit weak in comparison to Jool.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Sedah_InSpaceHigh = Energized plasma blasts Sedah, resulting in a fascinating repeating pattern of radio waves that should give the lab folks plenty of data to study.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sedah_InSpaceLow = Close-up photos reveal swirling, turbulent clouds and enormous hurricanes, some large enough to swallow entire planets!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sedah_InSpaceHigh = The planet glows due to the sheer heat of its atmosphere, making even the dark side glow dimly.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sedah_InSpaceLow = Atmospheric composition suggests the planet might normally have had a more cream-tinted coloration, but thanks to the extreme heat it glows a dull red.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sedah_InSpaceHigh = Sedah radiates heat very strongly, causing it to put out a lot more IR light than a gas planet normally would.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Sedah_InSpaceLow = Radio emissions from Sedah are wildly varied and immensely powerful, probably due to the complex interactions between the solar wind and its own internal processes.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Sedah_InSpaceLow = On the night side, hydrogen and helium trace particles are detected when orbiting through Sedah's enormous exosphere. On the day side, the collector is blasted with charged particles from the solar wind.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Sedah_InSpaceHigh = Not much besides the solar wind is detected here, though there are slight traces of ordinary hydrogen and helium which become more common when orbiting behind Sedah.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Sedah_InSpaceLow = The strong microwave emissions detected in orbit of Sedah are, no doubt, being produced by the planet's internal mechanisms.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Sedah_InSpaceHigh = An intense thermal reading is recorded from scans of Sedah, even on the night side. This is clearly being caused by the giant planet's ridiculously high temperature.
		
		// Suluco
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Suluco_SrfLanded = Suluco appears to have a weak magnetic field from the surface, meaning it doesn't offer as much protection from the solar wind as would be ideal. However, life on the twilight band persists regardless, as exposure to the sun is limited there anyway.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Suluco_InSpaceHigh = At this distance, Suluco's magnetic field is very faint. It doesn't appear to extend very far above the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Suluco_InSpaceHigh = Suluco's relatively weak magnetosphere doesn't deflect much of Sunorc's solar wind, but it does seem to do enough to protect life on the surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Suluco_InSpaceLow = Plasma wave analysis indicates a diffuse ring of charged particles around Suluco's equator; signs of a faint Van Kerman belt.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Suluco_InSpaceHigh = Though referred to as an eyeball planet, Suluco doesn't really look much like an eye. The stark contrast between its so-called "hot pole" and the twilight band is striking, however.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Suluco_InSpaceLowDay = Suluco's day side is almost eye-searingly bright, and it looks as dry as a bone. Endless seas of rolling sand dunes characterize the region.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Suluco_InSpaceLowDayPole = The substellar point is blinding; it's reflecting a lot of light and it looks so hot you could probably cook eggs on it. Even the clouds appear to have been vaporized.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Suluco_InSpaceLowNight = Can't see a thing.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Suluco_InSpaceLowTwilight = Suluco's narrow temperate regions have rolling green hills, and open oceans. You notice over several photos that the clouds are revolving about the day and night poles, rather than the planet's rotational axis.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Suluco_InSpaceLowWater = The oceans of Suluco are confined to a narrow strip along the day-night terminator, just as the life is. Ocean currents in these regions are unlike anything Kerbals have ever seen before.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Suluco_InSpaceHigh = A comprehensive scan of Suluco's atmosphere in UV and IR spectra reveal it's primarily comprised of nitrogen and oxygen, as expected.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Suluco_InSpaceLowDay = Suluco's day side is blasting light right back at Sunorc, reflecting a lot of light in both UV and IR spectra.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Suluco_InSpaceLowDayPole = The substellar point is reflecting by far the most sunlight, causing a noticeable spike in the IR readings.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Suluco_InSpaceLowNight = Infrared imaging allows a clearer look at Suluco's night side. Topography is, funnily enough, broadly similar to the day side- in that it's largely dominated by hills and mountains. Interestingly, however, Suluco's night side is also covered in craters.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Suluco_InSpaceLowTwilight = Trace gases detected during the analysis show clear signs of ongoing biological activity in the twilight strip, though they peter out over time the further you look into the day or night side.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Suluco_InSpaceLowWater = Thermal imaging reveals the underwater topography of Suluco's oceans. Given its unusual geography, there's going to be a lot to study here.
	
		//Non-Homeswitch Suluco Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Suluco_InSpaceLow = Solar wind produces some mildly interesting radio wave activity, but there's really nothing out of the ordinary.
		
		//Suluco Homeswitch Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_SulucoHome_InSpaceLow = Radio scans pick up scattered transmissions from various surface colonies and structures. Some small outposts are even located a good ways into both the day and night hemispheres. Kerbals haven't been here for all that long, but in that time we've already begun to make Suluco feel like home. If you tune it right, you can even pick up the latest headball game!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Suluco_SrfLandedDay = Traces of subsurface hydrogen are practically nonexistent here. Only tiny traces exist in spots of permanent shade.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Suluco_SrfLandedDayPole = At the substellar point, the surface isn't dry as a bone- at least those have SOME water. The only hydrogen here appears to consist of traces deposited by the constant solar wind.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Suluco_SrfLandedDesert = There's a little bit of hydrogen in this region, indicating water buried a bit below the surface. It's dry, but survivable.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Suluco_SrfLandedNight = According to hydrogen scans... or, er, visual scans, solid water ice covers every surface on the night side. Frigid snow blows and flows like sand in the lightless wastes.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Suluco_SrfLandedTwilight = Very high concentrations of hydrogen are found in twilight strip soil, mostly water of course. The majority of the planet's liquid water can be found here.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Suluco_SrfLandedWater = The extremely wet surface here naturally contains loads of hydrogen, and it absorbs most of the neutrons. You hope you aren't polluting the ocean or something.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Suluco_SrfLandedTwilight = Carbon compounds from the foliage as well as several types of rock are detected in the emissions.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Suluco_SrfLandedDesert = This parched desert still shows clear signs of life, as vaporizing the top layer of rock happens to reveal tiny tunnels dug out by alien insects, and the roots of a hardy type of grass.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Suluco_SrfLandedDay = The sun-bleached surface has no appreciable organic component; it's all just sand and rock.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Suluco_SrfLandedNight = In the darkness of the night side, only water ice and traces of various minerals are found. Even the mountains are covered in thick, permanent glaciers as solid as rock.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Suluco_SrfLandedNightCraters = This impact crater contains significantly more mineral compounds and metals on the surface than the surrounding perma-glaciers, almost surely originating from the impactor that formed the crater.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Suluco_SrfSplashedWater = Vaporizing the fluid confirms it is indeed water, but surely you didn't need this specialized instrument to determine that.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Suluco_InSpaceLow = In addition to somewhat weakened solar wind, nitrogen and oxygen particles from Suluco's atmosphere also become embedded in the wafers.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Suluco_InSpaceHigh = Suluco's weak magnetic field does little to stop the solar wind from impacting the wafers; the environment here isn't much different from interplanetary space.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Suluco_InSpaceLow = L-band microwave emissions are fairly constant across most of Suluco's surface, however as the antenna passes over the day hemisphere, readings drop gradually to basically zero above the substellar point.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Suluco_InSpaceHigh = Albedo varies drastically depending on whether the sensor is seeing more of the day hemisphere or the twilight band; far more so than most celestial bodies.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Suluco_SrfLandedTwilight = The soft soil absorbs some of the waves, but still gives insight as to how the geology varies between the day and night sides of Suluco.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Suluco_SrfLandedDay = Suluco's sandy day side is fantastic at absorbing seismic waves, so you really can't learn much here. Maybe you'd have more luck in the mountains?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Suluco_SrfLandedNight = The snow is densely packed here, making it impossible to glean anything useful from the data. The mountainous glaciers may offer more insight.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Suluco_SrfLandedMountainsDayTwilight = The hard surface conducts seismic waves well, giving you ample opportunity to study Suluco's interior. It appears Suluco is still rather geologically active, though volcanic activity is very sparse.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Suluco_SrfLandedMountainsNight = The rock-like glacier reflects cleanly throughout Suluco's crust, showing you evidence of massive subsurface caverns that may contain liquid water, and potentially isolated ecosystems!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Suluco_SrfLandedWater = Loose soil makes for a poor reflector of seismic waves, so you don't get much useful data.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Suluco_SrfSplashedWaterShallow = Suluco's shallow twilit waters feature a whole menagerie of microscopic and macroscopic life; but none are more fascinating than the 'schools' of colonial plants. They float in huge mats on the ocean's surface, with massive sails that catch both wind and sun.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Suluco_SrfSplashedWaterDeep = Deep beneath the surface, a wide array of colorful animals navigate the seafloor. In many ways they're like life on Kerbin, but very much unlike it in others. For one thing, with no day/night cycle, there's no diurnal vertical migration.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Suluco_SrfSplashedColdOceanShallow = The frigid conditions in Suluco's near-dark side oceans remind one of an arctic ocean, but since it's so close to warmer waters, the temperature changes much faster, and some animals move between both in a matter of hours.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Suluco_SrfSplashedColdOceanDeep = Deep sealife is much the same all over Suluco. Being isolated from the sun no matter the location, the life here is difficult to distinguish from those in warmer longitudes.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedTwilight = The core sample is teeming with life; not a surprise considering the green color of the ground here. Small organisms tunnel through the dirt and set up tiny dens where they raise their young in safety.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedDesert = Despite the harsher conditions, life here thrives much as it does in Kerbin's deserts. The sand is hot, but it also provides a nice repreive from the harsh sun for crafty animals, and represents an opportunity in the form of untapped resources, should anything be courageous enough to brave the heat.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedTundra = Suluco's twilit tundras have an eerie glow to them at all times; fitting considering they feel as cold as the grave. Still, life survives here. Whereas on the day side an insect might burrow to escape the sun, here they burrow to trap heat and remain warm. Plenty of animals nest here because the harsh conditions also offer safety from predators.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedDay = Though you don't expect to find anything, you might be surprised to see that even out here, tiny animals survive, in addition to hardy microorganisms. The animals are universally small, and have to spend almost their whole lives underground to avoid the sunlight, but they've adapted to handle the heat in shaded areas. Since the sun never moves, these shaded spots are permanent.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedNight = The night side of Suluco is desolate and unforgiving, but if life could survive on Kerbin's poles, it can here too. Contrasting the day side's tiny animals, these ones are usually huge, so as to generate as much body heat as possible- which they store within thick layers of fat. A select few species are even known to migrate across short stretches of the night side to avoid predators.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedDayPole = Despite the persistence of life on Suluco, the meager presence on the day side peters out gradually until you reach the substellar point- a place so hot, so desolate and inhospitable, that nothing besides extremophile microorganisms can survive here. Still, despite everything, SOMETHING lives here. Isn't that wild?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedNightPole = The night pole is the absolute coldest part of Suluco. Nowhere on Kerbin is this cold. And yet... One species persists. Titanic beasts soar in enormous flocks, navigating from one end of the twilight band to the other by cutting straight across the night side. They cover the distance in mere days, surviving thanks to their thick insulation and gliding in the dense, freezing air.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Suluco_SrfLandedWater = Some marine organisms seem to have laid their eggs on the shore here; a common sight throughout Suluco's beaches. Large invertebrates will lay their eggs here, burying them in the sand, to protect them from aquatic predators.
		
		// Tot
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Tot_SrfLanded = Still no magnetic activity to speak of, besides Suluco.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Tot_InSpace = The solar wind from Sunorc is strong here, it only really abates when you pass through Suluco's magnetotail or Tot's shadow.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Tot_InSpaceLow = The telescope captures a lot of tiny rocks and craters on Tot's surface in great detail, but it seems a little overpowered for this job.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Tot_InSpaceHigh = To be entirely fair to Tot, it is a rather cute little potato.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Tot_InSpace = Tot seems to be a primarily stony asteroid according to the multispectral analysis. Okay, are we done here?
	
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Tot_InSpaceLow = Sorry, nothing interesting going on here.
	
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Tot_SrfLanded = Nothing of note is detected in scans of the surface here.
	
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Tot_SrfLanded = The asteroid looks primarily rocky, but there is actually a bit more metal here than anticipated. Further study, particularly in the lower regions, may prove insightful.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Tot_SrfLandedLowlands = Low-lying regions of Tot have a much higher concentration of metal than expected. It appears Tot's composition is a mixture of rocky and metallic. This could explain its unusually high density.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Tot_SrfLandedCraters = Impact craters on Tot reveal deeper parts of the asteroid that are mostly metallic. If the interior is all like this, that might be why it has more than double Gilly's gravity despite being just under a third of its size.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Tot_InSpace = Solar wind content here is no different than it was in Suluco orbit.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Tot_InSpaceLow = The results of the experiment... are too boring to describe, sadly.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Tot_InSpaceHigh = Most of Tot's surface is dark and absorbs both visible and IR light, however the lowest regions are marginally more reflective. Curious...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Tot_SrfLanded = Careful! You'll break it! No, not the hammer, you dummy- the asteroid!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Tot_SrfLandedLowlandsCraters = The impact resonates more than expected, giving a clear picture of Tot's entire interior. The asteroid seems to have once been two- a metallic asteroid, and a stony impactor. This is the easiest explanation for the highly varied composition, which ranges from loosely-packed, poorly-resonating stone to solid, iron and nickel-rich sections that grow more common the deeper you go. This has to be why Tot is so dense.
		
		// Sera
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Sera_SrfLanded = Magnetic field lines stretch every which way on Sera's surface, indicating the clear presence of many powerful local magnetic fields in the vicinity.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Sera_InSpaceHigh = Strong magnetic readings, even at this altitude, indicate a powerful magnetosphere surrounds Sera. It's possible tidal forces from Dipuc have helped keep Sera's core active, but is it really close enough for that?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Sera_InSpaceLow = A ring of charged particles seems to be encircling Sera in low orbit; unmistakably a hazardous Van Kerman belt.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Sera_InSpaceHigh = As you pass through Sera's magnetotail, the already-weak solar wind abates significantly. Other readings suggest Sera's magnetic field is quite strong.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sera_InSpaceLowLakes = These lakes appear to be a kind of peach brown color, like the atmosphere. Just off the top of your head, there's no way to tell if they're water or not by simply looking.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sera_InSpaceLowIslands = Little islands peek out from the massive lakes- or would those be inland seas? One has to wonder what the view from those alien shores looks like.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sera_InSpaceLowRiftValley = This seems to be some kind of rift valley, a type of valley formed as the lithosphere is pulled apart due to extensional tectonics. This is pretty clear evidence of active tectonics on Sera, at least as of a good few hundred million years ago.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sera_InSpaceLowGeneric = Sera's peach-colored hills and plains look decidedly appetizing. It's begun to remind you far too much of a fruit.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sera_InSpaceLowMountains = Colossal mountain ranges span much of Sera's surface. A closer look reveals streaking, vein-like valleys spanning between the peaks, which form beautiful patterns not too dissimilar from a fractal.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Sera_InSpaceHigh = From high over Sera, its rings are revealed in sharp detail. The color and brightness of the rings would suggest they are rocky in composition- maybe with some ice too- and were probably once a small moon that was torn apart. With time and some simulations, we may be able to figure out what that moon might've looked like.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sera_InSpaceLow = Spectral scans show Sera's surface contains high quantities of heavy metals- in particular, iron, aluminum and titanium are quite prevalent. This helps to explain its pinkish-brown color.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sera_InSpaceLowLakes = The absorption spectrum of this liquid makes it pretty clear that this is water, not some other fluid.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Sera_InSpaceHigh = Spectroscopic analysis of Sera's rings point toward a siliceous composition, rather than a metallic one like its parent planet. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that whatever body formed these rings was a captured asteroid.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Sera_InSpaceLow = Intricate, but typical radio patterns are generated by interactions between Sunorc's solar wind and Sera's atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Sera_SrfLandedLakes = High-energy neutrons produce a clear response indicating that, given the temperature and pressure, the liquid must be water.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Sera_SrfLandedLowlandsIslands = The soil here is damp, and so produces a constant signal indicating subsurface water deposits.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Sera_SrfLandedRock = The rock here is fairly dry, and the instrument only detects traces of hydrogen beneath the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfLandedLowlands = The pinker low-lying areas of Sera seem to be composed of iron-rich rock, with a large helping of aluminum and titanium as well, which dilute the color and give it that pinkish-brown look.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfLandedMidlandsHighlands = The darker, higher areas of Sera are poor in aluminum and titanium compared to the lowlands, which explains their color.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfLandedMountains = Sera's mountains appear to be very rich in naturally-occurring lodestone, a highly magnetic kind of iron ore.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfLandedPeaks = Analysis shows this substance is water ice, which makes sense given the altitude.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfLandedPoles = Sera's poles appear to lack ice caps, but analysis shows that a light coating of water ice does exist here.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfLandedLakesIslands = The wet ground here is still rich in metals like most of the surface, however there is also a high concentration of water.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Sera_SrfSplashed = Scans of the liquid confirm it to be water, as expected. However, there's a high concentration of heavy metals and other toxins; making the presence of life extremely unlikely.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Sera_InSpaceLow = High amounts of charged particles and traces of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and even some heavy metals become embedded in the collectors. This is pretty clear evidence of a Van Kerman belt, but the other particles must be from Sera's atmosphere.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Sera_InSpaceHigh = Solar wind at this distance has grown quite weak, but it's still easy to gather a good number of solar particles with the ion concentrator and wafers.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Sera_InSpaceLow = Strong microwave emissions over the lakes are pretty clear evidence of water in relative abundance on Sera.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Sera_InSpaceHigh = Sera's surface and lakes appear to absorb a lot of UV and even shortwave IR light, suggesting a metal-rich surface and an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Sera_Rocky = Seismic waves generated by the impact reveal a very tectonically active planet. Plates continue to move gradually over the surface, and an intricate series of minor features may be formed by the slight tidal forces from its ring system and Dipuc.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Sera_Wet = The wet ground does not prove very conducive to seismic reflections, and you don't get much useful data. A higher, rockier vantage point may be a better choice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Sera_SrfSplashedShallow = Chemical analysis does not paint a pretty picture. Although the liquid is water, it's inundated with toxic heavy metals that make sustaining life very unlikely.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Sera_SrfSplashedDeep = Deep below the water's surface, Sera's lakes don't get any less toxic. Life existing here is highly improbable.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Sera_SrfLanded = The core sample is absolutely filled with highly toxic heavy metals, and nothing that could even be potentially interpreted as a biosignature. Oh well.
	
		// Dipuc
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded = Magnetic field lines appear to follow features that are not visible on its surface. This could be because molten magnetized rock is flowing deep below.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = Dipuc has a fairly substantial magnetic field, though it is not as powerful as one might expect. This could mean its volcanic activity is due to a combination of a still-molten core and tidal forces from Sera.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = At this altitude, a weak magnetic reading is detected from Dipuc. Getting closer would make it easier to verify its exact strength.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = In space near Dipuc, the solar wind is being noticeably deflected by its respectable magnetic field.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = High over the volcanic moon, charged particles are just as common as they were in Sera orbit.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLowGeneric = Dipuc's calamity-wracked, cratered surface must make for some great sights down on the ground. It's not often you see an airless moon as interesting as this. Why, it's at least as unique as Sera is!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLowCraterSouthCraterEast = Impact ejecta radiate out from this crater like rays of sunshine. And WOW, those lines go out far! Whatever made this crater had a lot of energy.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLowCraterWest = This sizable crater is a bit less dramatic than the two largest ones, and the lack of impact ejecta shows this.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLowDoubleCrater = Geologically speaking, this is not an unlikely formation at all. But it's still neat to see how the edges of these two craters overlap with one another.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLowVolcano = Dipuc's volcanoes are all constantly active, and minor eruptions happen pretty regularly. The telescope catches an umbrella-shaped plume of gas and dust as it's shot out of Dipuc and probably into Sera orbit.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceLowMountains = These pronounced mountain ridges are as clear as day in the telescope, and it captures striking images of the shadows they cast on the surface below.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = This moon reminds one just a bit of a well-kneaded ball of dough. Judging by the volcanic activity, it appears to be doing a good job of baking itself.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = UV scans show an exceptionally thin sulfur-rich atmosphere hovering low over the surface of the moon, likely produced actively by its volcanoes.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = Thermal imaging shows temperatures vary wildly across Dipuc, strongly correlated with volcanic activity.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = Surprisingly, Dipuc seems to be emitting weak radio waves. Long-term study will probably be required to determine the cause.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Dipuc_SrfLanded = Dipuc's surface appears to be quite poor in hydrogen according to the neutron scans.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Dipuc_SrfLandedPoles = Traces of hydrogen are indicated here, probably originating from small amounts of subsurface water ice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Dipuc_SrfLanded = The surface here is comprised of silicate rock rich in heavy metals, suggesting a similar composition to Sera and a common origin. It is found in the form of volcanic rock, naturally.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = The solar particle collector picks up traces of sulfur and various heavy metals, likely kicked up into space by the countless eruptions, and put into orbit by Sera's gravity.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = High over Dipuc, the solar wind is all the collector can collect.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Dipuc_InSpaceLow = Weak microwave emissions are detected from the poles, but nowhere else. Dipuc, rather predictably, is quite dry.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Dipuc_InSpaceHigh = Dipuc's rather dark, volcanic surface has a surprisingly high albedo in non-visible spectra- excluding IR wavelengths.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Dipuc_SrfLanded = Dipuc has a complex interior structure. Initial scans appear to suggest that Dipuc is shaped both by a still-molten core, and by tidal forces from Sera.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Dipuc_SrfLandedVolcano = It's impossible to get a clear read on Dipuc's internal makeup here because of the constant rumbling. This still provides fascinating data in its own right, though.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Dipuc_SrfLandedVolcanoVent = Now then. Don't get yourselves in a lava.
		
		// Noi
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Noi_SrfLanded = Hmm. Nope, still no magnetic field.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Noi_InSpace = Coal doesn't emit a magnetic field, ignoramus!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Noi_InSpace = Solar wind from Sunorc is extremely sparse at this distance, and Noi doesn't appear to have any influence on it beyond parting the flow like a tiny stone in a gentle stream.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noi_InSpaceLow = Where'd the stars go?! Oh, that's just Noi. False alarm...
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noi_InSpaceHigh = Okay, I give up. What am I supposed to be looking at?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Noi_InSpaceLow = Carbon-rich rock and some more stony silicate materials are detected in detailed scans of Noi's surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Noi_InSpaceHigh = Thermal imaging reveals just how cold Noi really is. It's carbonaceous according to the scans, but it could've easily been icy at this distance from Sunorc.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Noi_InSpaceLow = Do-dodo-do-doooo... Uh, nothing. No radio activity here.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Noi_SrfLanded = In such a calm environment largely devoid of ambient neutrons, a high-precision reading can be taken. For its distance from Sunorc, Noi is very much lacking in ice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Noi_SrfLanded = Surface scans indicate an extremely carbon-rich surface scattered with other minerals, mostly silicates.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Noi_InSpace = Nothing has really changed in the vicinity of Noi compared to interplanetary space.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Noi_InSpaceLow = Only very weak microwave emissions indicate that Noi is surprisingly dry for an asteroid so far from Sunorc. It's possible it formed further in and got kicked into the outer system, eventually ending up here.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Noi_InSpaceHigh = Now that's one dark asteroid. Noi strongly absorbs light in almost every spectrum, even having a lot of UV absorption for a C-type asteroid. The result is an object that's only just barely visible, especially since it's so far from its star.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Noi_SrfLanded = The low-density asteroid absorbs the seismic waves pretty well, making data quite hard to gather. But it's not hard to guess what the interior looks like, anyway.
		
		// SimeSystem
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_SimeSystem_InSpaceHigh = This part of space receives very little solar wind, so nearly all the radio activity here is generated by the two massive magnetic fields interacting with themselves, and the other moons' atmospheres.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_SimeSystem_InSpaceHigh = The intricate dance the two bodies perform is nothing short of breathtaking, and a timelapse of photos proves it. They're like partners in some sort of giant, awesome celestial tango.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_SimeSystem_InSpaceHigh = Spectral analysis of both bodies shows evidence of lots of methane in both atmospheres. Explanations for Simetra's green and blue bands are still elusive...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_SimeSystem_InSpaceHigh = Solar wind particles are quite sparse out here, and the collector only picks up traces of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and chlorine dioxide.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_SimeSystem_InSpaceHigh = Taken together, both bodies have quite a high combined albedo. Simeht in particular is quite bright.
		
		// Simetra/Simeht Shared
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_SimeBoth_InSpaceHigh = An incredibly complex electrostatic environment is found here between the two planets, as their magnetospheres and atmospheres interact.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_SimBoth_InSpaceLow = Both giant planets' magnetic fields are producing powerful radio waves from their interactions, resulting in a cacophony of radio noise.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_SimeBoth_InSpace = The collectors pick up traces of hydrogen, helium, and methane as Simetra and Simeht dance between each other.
		
		// Simetra
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Simetra_InSpaceLow = Powerful radio waves emit from Simetra's atmosphere, though the slightly less massive Simeht is a very close second.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Simetra_InSpace = Simetra's colorful bands make you wonder just what compounds are giving the equatorial longitudes those striking green and yellow hues.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Simetra_InSpace = Its upper atmosphere appears to consist mostly of methane, while lower layers are largely hydrogen, helium and methane, with traces of sulfur and chlorine dioxide. This chlorine dioxide may explain its green bands, in combination with the methane.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Simetra_InSpaceLow = Microwave emissions from Simetra indicate an interior full of water ice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Simetra_InSpaceHigh = In the IR spectrum, Simetra outputs a fair bit more than Simeht, indicating higher temperatures and a more energetic internal heating process.
		
		// Simeht
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Simeht_InSpaceLow = Simeht's marginally less massive atmosphere appears to generate radio wave emissions that are weaker by a similar margin.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Simeht_InSpace = Simeht appears nearly featureless in distant telescope images, however this up-close-and-personal look reveals its lighter equatorial bands, the faint swirling hypercanes on the borders, and even the subtle differences between the more polar bands.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Simeht_InSpace = Simeht's hydrogen-helium atmosphere also contains a lot of methane, which helps explain its light cyan color.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Simeht_InSpaceLow = Powerful microwave emissions signal the presence of large quantities of water ice deep within Simeht.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Simeht_InSpaceHigh = Simeht reflects a lot of light in the visible spectrum, giving it a high albedo.
		
		// Noira
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Noira_SrfLanded = On the surface, small localized magnetic fields can be detected, but the moon appears to lack a larger magnetic field of its own. That, or it's imperceptible compared to the twin planets, and the data will need to be studied with greater precision.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Noira_InSpace = Simetra and Simeht's magnetic fields overpower the sensors, and nothing can be detected coming from Noira.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Noira_InSpace = Only radio plasma activity being generated by Simetra and Simeht is detected. All Noira does is part the flow.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noira_InSpaceLowGeneric = Noira's crater-spotted surface is a welcome sight in a system full of oddities.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noira_InSpaceLowGrandCrater = "The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Kraken."
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noira_InSpaceLowCraters = Craters are evenly distributed along the entire surface of the moon, indicating it is not tidally locked. That's probably because Simetra and Simeht simply move around too much.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noira_InSpaceLowRiftValleys = It's pretty clear that tidal forces must be stretching poor Noira to the breaking point, creating these huge rift valleys.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noira_InSpaceLowBasins = These wide, dark basins remind one of simpler times, when the space program was still struggling to put boots on the Mun.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noira_InSpaceHigh = The little gray ball reminds one of the Mun, both in color and in the craters that mark its surface. A proportionally huge crater can be seen on one end of the moon, inviting comparisons to a certain planet-busting battle station.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Noira_InSpaceLow = Regolith on Noira has a similar composition to the Mun, with high concentrations of silicates and aluminum.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Noira_InSpaceHigh = Analysis of Noira from high orbit shows a chaotic surface, pockmarked with craters and covered in depressions.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Noira_InSpaceLow = Radio surveillance of Noira reveals nothing interesting, just signals reflected from the twin planets.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Noira_SrfLanded = Sub-surface hydrogen is detected all over Noira; likely evidence of water deposits.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Noira_SrfLanded = Surface scans make for a familiar read; a silicate-rich surface with plentiful aluminum. Less familiar is the notable concentration of water ice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Noira_InSpace = Trace particles near Noira seem to be much the same as elsewhere in the Simetra-Simeht system.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Noira_InSpaceLow = Readings indicate large quantities of water ice are buried beneath the surface of the little moon, which could potentially mean Noira has subsurface water oceans!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Noira_InSpaceHigh = Overall albedo of Noira is quite similar to that of the Mun, but its sheer distance from Sunorc means its absolute irradiance is very low.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Noira_SrfLanded = Seismic reflections clearly show evidence of large underground caverns, possibly filled with liquid water!
		
		// Norihc
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Norihc_SrfLanded = A weak magnetic field can be measured from Norihc's surface, but it's nothing especially impressive.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Norihc_InSpaceLow = Norihc's geological activity does not appear to produce a strong magnetic field. As the geological activity is likely being generated mostly by tidal forces, Norihc probably lacks a molten metal core- which would explain it.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = The only magnetic fields detected so far belong to Simetra and Simeht.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Norihc_InSpace = Faint disruptions are generated as Simetra and Simeht's magnetospheres are distorted by Norihc.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Norihc_InSpaceLowGeneric = The fissured surface of Norihc appears rather reminiscent of Eeloo, with its deep trenches and darker lowlands.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Norihc_InSpaceLowCratersAll = Norihc is marked by craters large and small, calling into question just how ancient the surface is. If it's being stretched by the two planets, why does it seem like its surface hasn't changed in so long?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Norihc_InSpaceLowCracks = These cracks run deep into Norihc's thick global ice caps. They'd probably make for fun race tracks!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = Poor Norihc seems to have been battered and bruised by tidal forces from its parent planets.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Norihc_InSpaceLow = Spectroscopy of the surface confirms that it's largely made up of water ice, with partially frosted-over tholin compounds in the lowlands.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = Norihc's atmosphere is primarily made up of nitrogen, with traces of carbon monoxide and other gases.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Norihc_InSpaceLow = Radio activity in Norihc orbit is quiet, save for the noise being generated by Simetra and Simeht.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Norihc_SrfLanded = Hydrogen signals in this region seem to confirm thick water ice caps, with the potential of a liquid water ocean far below.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Norihc_SrfLanded = The beam causes a burst of steam as it blasts a hole in the surface, confirming it to be water ice.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Norihc_SrfLandedLowlands = In addition to steam, the scan also indicates the existence of tholin compounds on the surface here.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Norihc_InSpace = Traces of nitrogen can be found in orbit of Norihc, but otherwise space is even emptier than usual.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Norihc_InSpaceLow = Water is quite common all over Norihc, even in the lowlands where the reading is weakest. If there are liquid oceans beneath the surface, this instrument is not able to distinguish them.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Norihc_InSpaceHigh = Norihc's thin atmosphere does not absorb much, allowing the bright surface to reflect a lot of light in most wavelengths except UV.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Norihc_SrfLanded = Seismic readings taken show clear signs of a liquid ocean below the surface of Norihc. Given the presence of organic compounds, life is a distinct possibility.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Norihc_SrfLanded = This core sample is mostly just ice, with some tholin compounds that seem to have become trapped inside after formation. If there's a subsurface ocean on Norihc, the drill can't reach it.
		
		// Noyreg
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Noyreg's magnetic field does not appear to change much on the surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = For such a large object with so much gravity, Noyreg's magnetic field is pretty weak. This may be due to a combination of a mostly-cooled iron-rich core, and a lack of magnetic minerals on the surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Noyreg_InSpaceHigh = A weak magnetic field is detected from high above Noyreg; and it's weaker than anticipated. Further study may shed some light on this mystery.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Noyreg_InSpace = Solar radiation releases charged particles from Noyreg's thick atmosphere, producing plasma waves as they interact with the twin giants' dancing magnetic fields.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = There's not much to see with all the dense clouds covering the surface. Only a bit of the surface is visible, but all that can be made out are some high mountains peeking through the lowest clouds.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Noyreg_InSpaceHigh = What a fascinating color! Surely this won't re-ignite the age-old Jool color debates...
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = Peering through the dense cloud cover shows signs of a surface incredibly rich in carbon. It's possible that Noyreg is made of mostly carbon, but that would make it an exceptionally rare find indeed!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Noyreg_InSpaceHigh = Spectroscopic analysis shows an atmosphere made of mostly carbon dioxide, with the rest being nitrogen, chlorine dioxide, and trace gases. From this initial analysis, the source of its green color is not clear. It could be the chlorine dioxide, or an unprecedented kind of scattering effect. Further study is necessary.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = Noyreg's thick atmosphere creates rhythmic radio signals as it is energized by Simetra and Simeht's magnetospheres.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = Noyreg's surface seems to be rich in hydrogen. But at these temperatures and pressures, it's most likely long-chain hydrocarbons rather than water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = The flare produced identifies the substance as extremely carbon-rich; the majority of the composition is actually carbon. This is highly unusual, and would appear to suggest that Noyreg is a very rare type of object- a carbonia, or carbon world.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Noyreg_SrfLandedIceCaps = Laser analysis confirms the presence of several long-chain hydrocarbons are frozen here, and there's no sign of water ice.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Noyreg_InSpace = Space near Noyreg contains trace amounts of carbon dioxide, probably originating from the moon's dense atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Noyreg_InSpaceLow = Little microwave emissions are detected from Noyreg, which seems to mean it has little to no water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Noyreg_InSpaceHigh = Noyreg's dense atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV and IR light, and it absorbs a lot of the visible spectrum too. This could be why it looks green.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Noyreg_SrfLanded = The interior composition of Noyreg reveals that much of it shares a similar density to diamond, and if the readings are right it only has a small, largely dead metallic core. That confirms it, Noyreg is mostly made of carbon.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Noyreg_SrfLanded = The core sample is absolutely filled with carbon! As in... just lots and lots of carbon and hydrocarbon compounds, none of which seem to have been formed by biological activity.
		
		// Aralc-A
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The instrument has skipped melting and is beginning to sublimate.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = The solar wind coming from Aralc-A is extremely powerful, even at this distance.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_AralcA_InSpace = MY EYES!!!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_AralcA_InSpace = The imaging platform outright refuses to expose its delicate instruments. You're going to need a more specialized tool for this kind of work.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_AralcA_InSpaceLow = Aralc-A emits extreme amounts of radiation in most spectra, especially ones this instrument cannot detect. But we know what blue stars are like, right? We didn't -really- need to bring this heavy thing all the way out here, did we?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_AralcA_InSpaceLow = Well, one thing's for sure. The warranty is definitely void now.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = Aralc-A's solar wind is far more powerful than even this instrument was really built for, but it's hanging in there admirably.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_AralcA_InSpaceLow = The antennae have begun to resemble water much more closely than this star does.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_AralcA_InSpaceHigh = Aralc-A outputs a lot more UV light than most smaller, cooler stars do. Anything living in this star system would have to be pretty well-protected- and it wouldn't have too much time to evolve, either. But, as they say... "Efil", uh, finds a way.
		
		// Anneheg
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Anneheg_SrfLanded = The sheer amount of radiation here has rendered the poor boom non-functional, though at the very least it's staying... -mostly- straight.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Anneheg_InSpace = I want you to take a guess as to just how much solar plasma is flowing through here. Then, take that guess and multiply it by one hundred. There's your answer.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Anneheg_InSpaceLow = The swirling, glassy features of Anneheg showcase just how badly damaged the planet's surface is. It's unlikely it formed at this distance from Aralc-A, or it would've been obliterated eons ago.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Anneheg_InSpaceLowLava = Anneheg's oceans of lava streak across the planet like open wounds. Aralc-A is blasting this world apart.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Anneheg_InSpaceHigh = Anneheg is hard to make out in the sea of blinding light, especially with how dark its igneous surface is.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Anneheg_InSpaceLow = Scans of Anneheg's surface indicate volcanic glass with an extremely high metal content; it's likely this planet is just a thin crust covering the core of a once much larger planet.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Anneheg_InSpaceHigh = Despite the extremely low albedo of the planet, Anneheg's absolute irradiance is still high due to the veritable death ray being blasted at its surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Anneheg_InSpaceLow = Only the intense radio activity from Aralc-A can be detected here.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Anneheg_SrfLanded = Surface hydrogen readings are assuredly only the result of the absurd solar wind depositing it on the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Anneheg_SrfLanded = Anneheg's surface is so heat-resistant that the laser doesn't even do anything to it. Well, that's a bust.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Anneheg_InSpaceLow = Anneheg appears to be losing mass, judging by the rock and metal being picked up by the collector; especially when crossing the twilight line.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Anneheg_InSpaceHigh = At this altitude, only Aralc-A's extreme solar wind is collected.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Anneheg_InSpaceLow = The antennae can barely function so close to Aralc-A, but they don't detect anything coming from the planet anyway.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Anneheg_InSpaceHigh = Anneheg's absolute irradiance is very high despite the extremely dark surface, owing to its proximity to Aralc-A.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Anneheg_SrfLanded = The impact confirms Anneheg's composition is highly metallic; at least 80% of the object is metal.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Anneheg_SrfSplashedShallow = Huh. Now that's odd. We seem to have not melted yet.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Anneheg_SrfSplashedDeep = A Potion of Fire Resistance would help us see much more clearly down here.
		
		// Aralc-B
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_AralcB_InSpaceLow = Intense solar wind is being blasted from both stars, giving the antennae quite a lot to process.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_AralcB_InSpaceHigh = You're really not all that far from Aralc-B, so the solar plasma is already quite dense here without even factoring in Aralc-A's contributions.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_AralcB_InSpace = It may be a red dwarf, but it's still a star. Pointing a sensitive planetary telescope at it is a poor decision.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_AralcB_InSpace = The imaging platform shuts itself down upon detecting the light from Aralc-B. Even a red dwarf is too bright for it to study.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_AralcB_InSpaceLow = Radio waves emitted by both stars are very intense, and you begin to doubt the structural integrity of the massive dish.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_AralcB_InSpaceLow = The sensitive wafers have begun to deteriorate rapidly under the intense heat.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_AralcB_InSpaceHigh = Solar wind coming from Aralc-B is fairly equal with the wind from Aralc-A at this distance.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_AralcB_InSpaceLow = The device cannot tolerate the heat, and the advanced polymers that constitute its chemical makeup have begun to break down. In other words, space water findy thing broke.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_AralcB_InSpaceHigh = As a red dwarf, Aralc-B outputs a lot of infrared light, and is rather dim in the visible and UV spectra.
		
		// Arorua
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Arorua_SrfLanded = From the surface, it seems Arorua has a rather strong magnetic field of its own, which could be stemming the tide of charged particles a bit and prolonging the life of its atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Arorua_InSpace = Charged particles inundate the space around Arorua, an easy and obvious explanation for its ablating atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Arorua_InSpaceLowGeneric = Arorua's surface is mostly hilly and dark, but in the extreme sunlight it shines like glass. Maybe some of it -is- glass!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Arorua_InSpaceLowSubstellarPoint = The point facing Aralc-B is mostly featureless, but knowing that this is the point where all the sunlight is concentrated makes one wonder just how hot it must be there.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Arorua_InSpaceLowMountainsAll = Aralc's mountains shine through the lower atmosphere, highlighted against the darker lowlands.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Arorua_InSpaceLowCliffsAll = These cliffs are pretty sharp. They might make for a good sightseeing destination.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Arorua_InSpaceHigh = The aurorae of Arorua shine brilliantly below, and you wonder why it's not covered in more opaque clouds. Perhaps it was at one point, but the intense sunlight blew them away too.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Arorua_InSpaceLow = IR scans of the surface of Arorua provide an intricate map of the way the planet is heated by its twin suns.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Arorua_InSpaceHigh = Spectral analysis of Arorua's atmosphere reveals it's mostly composed of carbon dioxide, and not much else.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Arorua_InSpaceLow = As Arorua's atmosphere ablates away, it generates a deluge of intense radio activity.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Arorua_SrfLanded = Background neutron levels are quite high, thanks to Aralc-B. This is despite the thick atmosphere, and it makes it difficult to take an accurate reading.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Arorua_SrfLanded = Laser blast scans reveal a fairly typical composition for the surface of a rocky planet, with siliceous minerals making up the majority share of the surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Arorua_InSpaceLow = In low Arorua orbit, a relatively high concentration of carbon dioxide molecules are picked up, probably from its ablating atmosphere.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Arorua_InSpaceHigh = The solar wind fills the space near Arorua, threatening to start blowing away the spacecraft too!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Arorua_InSpaceLow = The only detectable microwave readings are coming from Aralc-B and Aralc-A.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Arorua_InSpaceHigh = Despite Arorua's thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, absolute irradiance is quite high due to its proximity to two stars. The enormous, shimmering aurorae probably also help.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Arorua_SrfLanded = Sophisticated hammer smash analysis suggests Arorua has a fairly typical composition for a terrestrial world, with a rocky crust and a partially molten metallic core.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Arorua_SrfLanded = It may be unlikely, farfetched, or even insane- but you take a lifeless core sample anyway, just to be absolutely sure.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Arorua_SrfLandedSubstellarPoint = Look, you never know, okay? YOU NEVER KNOW.
		
		// Ahtpan
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Ahtpan_SrfLanded = After a comprehensive analysis, you surmise that while Ahtpan's magnetic field is relatively weak, it's just about strong enough to keep the solar winds at bay.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceLow = The magnetic field coming from Ahtpan is substantially stronger here, enough to turn the figurative tempest of charged particles into just a manageable gale.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceHigh = Radio wave patterns indicate clear distortion in the magnetic environment here; this is likely the work of a field surrounding Ahtpan. 
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceLowGeneric = Ahtpan looks like a desert world straight out of a sci-fi movie. But no science fiction author thus far has been so inspired as to dream up oceans of oil! Truth is stranger than fiction, it seems- and maybe more awesome, too. Less space dogfights, though...
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceLowMountains = Ahtpan's mountains stand out with redder hues, providing a nice contrast from the rest of the beige surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceLowNaphthaOceansCoast = These photos will surely secure us plenty of funding from the petroleum industry.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceLowIslands = Anything can be bought and sold for the right OOOIIIILLLLL!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceLowCraters = Ahtpan has a decently thick atmosphere, so what few impactors manage to make it through have to be big ones. The size of these craters is proof of that.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceHigh = The prospect of an entire planet covered in oceans of black gold was too enticing to pass up. So you train the telescope on Ahtpan, and start to take pictures.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Ahtpan_InSpaceLow = The spectral analysis is unmistakable- those are oceans of naphtha. Entire seas of precious "explodium" await exploitation- whether for ISRU or for profit!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Ahtpan_InSpaceHigh = Ahtpan's atmosphere is made mostly of carbon dioxide, but there are also very large concentrations of hydrocarbon vapors in many regions.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Ahtpan_InSpaceLow = Radio surveillance turns up nothing but static during scans of Ahtpan. That's perfect- no alien oil mining operations means we have the planet all to ourselves! First come first served, eh, ET?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Ahtpan_SrfLanded = Even on land, the sensor picks up a lot of hydrogen deposits. Even the ground is rich with the stuff!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Ahtpan_SrfSplashed = A very strong hydrogen signature confirms our wildest hopes- that Ahtpan's surface is covered with oceans of naphtha.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ahtpan_SrfLanded = Chemical analysis of the sandy surface reveals a mostly siliceous composition, with a lot of hydrocarbons sprinkled throughout.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ahtpan_SrfSplashed = The substance reacts violently to the laser and combusts! Yep, that's oil alright.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Ahtpan_InSpaceLow = Solar wind is a bit more sparse here, and the instrument picks up trace amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Ahtpan_InSpaceHigh = Ahtpan is being blasted pretty hard by Aralc-A, but the solar wind is a little less intense here than interplanetary space, implying the existence of a moderately strong magnetic field.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Ahtpan_InSpaceLow = Microwave emissions from Ahtpan are very weak, indicating the substance on its surface is not water.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Ahtpan_InSpaceHigh = Ahtpan's atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV and shortwave IR frequencies, indicating a majority of it is probably carbon dioxide. The surface has a pretty high albedo, which helps to offset the greenhouse effect somewhat.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Ahtpan_SrfLanded = Seismic waves show that Ahtpan's interior is still somewhat active, and its core is most likely still molten.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Ahtpan_SrfSplashedShallow = The camera can't really see anything in the thick oil, but the chemical analysis confirms it to be a type of naphtha.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Ahtpan_SrfSplashedDeep = I can't see crap, Captain!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Ahtpan_SrfLanded = The core sample reveals a whole lot of naphtha, but not much else. There are no signs of ongoing biological activity.
		
		// Anehta
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Anehta_InSpaceLow = Magnetometer readings confirm the presence of multiple Van Kerman radiation belts in low Anehta orbit.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Anehta_InSpaceHigh = Anehta's magnetic field is fairly typical for a gas giant, though because of its extreme mass it is one of the most powerful planetary magnetic fields ever observed.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Anehta_InSpaceLow = Powerful and frequent "Lightning whistler" radio wave emissions are detected from Anehta's, suggesting a chaotic atmosphere with a lot of geomagnetic activity.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Anehta_InSpaceHigh = Anehta's powerful magnetic field captures and accelerates charged particles from its two stars. This process causes repeating radio wave pulses that match its rotational period.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Anehta_InSpaceLow = The blue skies below make for quite the pretty picture, and you capture its massive towers of water vapor in spectacular detail. You're certain that Kerbin in its entirety could fit inside of some of these storms.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Anehta_InSpaceHigh = Anehta's blue-white rings match the gas giant pretty closely in color, but how can this be? It can't be ice; Anehta is well within its stars' frost line. Perhaps the rings are made of the same stuff as Eulb?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Anehta_InSpaceLow = Comprehensive scans of Anehta's upper clouds show a composition of mostly hydrogen, helium, and water vapor.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Anehta_InSpaceHigh = Scans of Anehta indicate it is a Class II gas giant according to the Sudarskerb classification system. Its bright blue-white upper cloud decks reflect a lot of visible light, and strong UV absorption indicates they're made of water vapor.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Anehta_InSpaceLow = Anehta releases a symphony of radio signals as its lower atmosphere swirls and storms, and the solar wind that made it through its magnetosphere uselessly blasts away at its deep atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Anehta_InSpaceLow = Protected from the solar wind by Anehta, the collectors mostly pick up hydrogen, helium and water molecules.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Anehta_InSpaceHigh = The solar wind near Anehta is similar in strength to Kerbin, but it rapidly abates as the craft passes deeper into the giant's powerful magnetosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Anehta_InSpaceLow = A strong microwave signal is received; an indication that Anehta's atmosphere contains abundant water vapor.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Anehta_InSpaceHigh = Anehta has a fairly high albedo, owing to its pleasant blue-white coloration. Strong thermal emissions, even on the dark side, indicate a lot of internal heating.
		
		// Enots
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Enots_SrfLanded = Enots does not seem to generate a magnetic field. What a shocker...
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Enots_InSpace = The only magnetosphere the instrument can detect originates from Anehta.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Enots_InSpace = Enots causes only minor distortions in Anehta's magnetosphere as the proverbial stone in the river divides its flow.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Enots_InSpaceLow = The tiny little moonlet looks like someone took a big chunk of shale and chucked it into orbit.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Enots_InSpaceHigh = ?taht si eman fo dnik tahW ?"enotS" gniht siht deman ylsuoires enoemoS !etunim a tsuj tiaW 
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Enots_InSpace = Multispectral analysis shows that Enots is primarily made of dark silicate minerals.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Enots_InSpaceLow = The only radio signals here are coming from Anehta.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Enots_SrfLanded = Weak hydrogen signals could be explained as wisps of Anehta's exosphere that were scooped up by this little moon.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Enots_SrfLanded = The laser blasts away a small ridge, revealing a composition of mostly silicate rock- specifically, chalcedony. There are traces of aluminum oxides that could be corundum, which explains the slight blue tint the equatorial regions have.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Enots_InSpace = The collectors pick up a great many particles from Anehta's rings, revealing a composition of mostly silicate minerals and aluminum oxides, which could be blue corundum.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Enots_InSpaceLow = Enots does not seem to be generating any microwave emissions, ruling out the presence of water ice on or under its surface.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Enots_InSpaceHigh = Enots has a very low albedo, but spectral analysis does not indicate the presence of carbon. This suggests another origin for its black color.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Enots_SrfLanded = Seismic waves reflect well across the small moon, an indication that it's quite dense and held together well by structural forces.
		
		// Efil
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Efil_SrfLanded = The magnetometer captured Efil's strong magnetic field from the surface, showing how the field lines align just so with the moon's axis of rotation, like two dancers in perfect sync with one another.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Efil_InSpace = Efil's ionosphere interacts with Anehta's powerful magnetic field, painting a colorful picture of the relationship between these two worlds' atmospheres and magnetospheres- Anehta the protector, and Efil the ever-defiant child eager to prove that it... can... deflect solar wind, uh, on its own? Look, I'm running out of material here. 
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceHigh = Like a perfect blue marble, Efil shines in shades of blue-green in the telescope. The picture cannot truly capture Efil's beauty, but it can at least preserve a fraction of it.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowWater = Efil's oceans shine in the light of twin suns, illuminated in bright cyan like an illustration straight off the cover of a classic sci-fi novel.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowRainforests = Dense rainforests of alien trees with blue-green leaves cover much of the planet's surface, bringing to mind images of a romanticized ancient Kerbin, one where colossal beasts still roamed the world- yet while that version of Kerbin is long gone, Efil floats here, decidedly tangible.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowGrassland = Rolling green hills span Efil in the low-lying regions, dotted with flower beds and framed by rainforests as though painted by a master artist.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowTropicalDesert = The tropical deserts of Efil may be less hospitable than most of the planet, but they are no less beautiful. Dunes of sand roll like the grassy hills do elsewhere, no doubt roamed by herds of hardened, desert-dwelling animals- as evidenced by the long tracks left in the sand.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowNeedleleafForests = The arctic forests of Efil are as lush and full of life as the warmer climates, blanketed by vast stretches of untamed wilderness and glazed with snow.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowTundraColdDesert = The chilly, barren regions of Efil are some of the only places devoid of the beauty that encompasses the rest of the planet. Instead, they are barren and mostly lifeless; some of the only remaining patches of desolation on the teeming world of Efil.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Efil_InSpaceLowMountainsSnowMountains = The peaks of Efil peer above the clouds, as if to get a better view of the gorgeous landscape that surrounds them. Doubtless not much lives up there, but there's a sort of peace to that, is there not? Standing atop such a peak, one would surely feel only tranquility.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Efil_InSpaceHigh = Efil's wide tapestry of color extends well into the non-visible spectra, filling out a veritable canvas of data for our scientists to study. What is certain is that, much like Kerbin, its atmosphere contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen; clear signs of life when combined with the images of Efil painted in visible light.
		
		//Non-Homeswitch Efil Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Efil_InSpaceLow = The highly varied geology and biology of Efil form a complex picture, telling the rich history of a moon wreathed in the embrace of life. From soaring mountains to rolling plains, dense jungles to deep oceanic trenches, Efil has a lot to offer. Tourists are gonna love this place! I'm putting that in the travel brochure.
		//Non-Homeswitch Efil Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Efil_InSpaceLow = Radio activity from Efil's atmosphere tells of its interactions with Anehta's magnetosphere, but there's no one singing this song. That is to say- there's no evidence of intelligent life.
		
		//Efil Homeswitch Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_EfilHome_InSpaceLow = The highly varied geology and biology of Efil form a complex picture, telling the rich history of a moon wreathed in the embrace of life. From soaring mountains to rolling plains, dense jungles to deep oceanic trenches, Efil has a lot to offer.
		//Efil Homeswitch Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_EfilHome_InSpaceLow = Efil's atmosphere sings a song of magnetism and- wait, hang on, cut the purple prose crap. I can hear the latest headball game coming on, I want to listen!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Efil_SrfLandedRainforestsGrassland = Efil's damp, fertile soil is rich with the hydrogen atoms of water molecules, breathing life into its great forests and sprawling grasslands.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Efil_SrfLandedTropicalDesert = Though the sand here is dry, traces of water continue to provide the denizens of the desert with much-needed refreshment.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Efil_SrfLandedArcticBiomes = Frozen in ice and snow, the arctic soil willingly provides fresh water to those willing to take it.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Efil_SrfLandedMountains = The mountains of Efil are comparatively dry, mostly devoid of life as such high altitudes render even Efil unable to provide for its inhabitants.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Efil_SrfLandedSnowMountains = Snowy peaks provide great vistas, but make poor soil for life to establish a foothold. Despite the abundance of water, there is naught to drink.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Efil_SrfLandedBeach = The wet sand here would stick to your toes, were you there in person to enjoy it. The hydrogen content tells you what's already obvious by the camera feed; this beach is regularly touched by life-giving, crystalline waters.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfSplashedWater = Blasting away at the undulating waves confirms that it is indeed precious, refreshing liquid water- albeit with an unpalatable salinity.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfLandedRainforestsGrassland = Surface scans show an abundance of hydrogen, not only in water but in organic compounds as well; a testament to Efil's burgeoning ecosystem.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfLandedTropicalDesert = The laser penetrates deep into the dry sand, revealing precious little hydrogen. For such an arid region, this makes sense.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfLandedMountains = The high altitudes of Efil's mountains are deficient in both water and life.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfLandedArcticBiomes = Even the most frigid regions on Efil are teeming with life; a thin layer of snow on the surface conceals a bed of activity below.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfLandedSnowMountains = Though plenty of water ice can be found on these snowy peaks, little else is to be found, as these areas are too remote for much to survive.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Efil_SrfLandedBeach = It seems wasteful to confirm what is already obvious using this expensive instrument... Perhaps you're simply in disbelief that any moon could have such clear and clean seas?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Efil_InSpaceLow = Skimming the outermost layer of Efil's atmosphere, the instrument collects water molecules in addition to the solar wind- a clear sign that Efil is as much a tropical retreat as it appears.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Efil_InSpaceHigh = Heavier elements are deposited in the wafers, evidence that Efil has a sort of Van Kerman belt of its own- almost as though it means to imprison the life that lives upon it. Perhaps Efil is not as gracious a host as previously thought?
		
		//Non-Homeswitch Efil Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Efil_InSpaceLow = Microwave emissions make it even more clear that Efil's surface is practically soaked with water. Though seemingly a pointless endeavor, one must never forget the frigid false paradise that Laythe turned out to be, hence, it is wise to check.
		//Efil Homeswitch Only
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_EfilHome_InSpaceLow = Microwave emissions make it even more clear that Efil's surface is practically soaked with water. This was known already, however, it serves as a useful calibration of the instrument if nothing else- and reminds us what a false paradise Laythe turned out to be, in ages past.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Efil_InSpaceHigh = Efil's bright surface is strongly tinted a gorgeous shade of cyan by its thick atmosphere, which absorbs most UV and near-IR light.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Efil_SrfLandedSandy = The powdery surface beneath does a great job of absorbing seismic waves, resisting your attempts to uncover its secrets.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Efil_SrfLandedSoily = The soil below dulls most waves that pass through, but whispers hints of caverns stretching deep beneath the surface.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Efil_SrfLandedRocky = The seismic waves travel well here, showing you a clearer picture of Efil's interior- though with all the caves and layers, it is nothing too surprising.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Efil_SrfSplashedWaterShallow = A treasure trove of bioluminescent fauna swim about Efil's warm tropical waters, revealed in great detail by the crystal-clear waters.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Efil_SrfSplashedWaterDeep = The dark depths of Efil are hardly dark at all, as glowing sea life dot the landscape all the way out to the horizon, appearing as stars swimming through an alien ocean.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedBeach = In the intertidal zone, a small mammal-like animal makes its home inside a shell, a charming inversion of a familiar concept from Kerbin and a prime example of convergent evolution. It uses the discarded shells of other sea creatures for shelter, but can move surprisingly fast if forced to abandon it.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedRainforests = A slimy, four-limbed creature swings from branch to branch of the trees in the dense canopy, looking almost like some kind of vertebrate Kraken. Or at least, it would if it were not a striking blue color. The creature eyes your craft with particular interest as you take a soil sample, and descends the tree to give it a harmless poke before swiftly retreating.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedGrassland = Herds of stocky beasts with six legs and wrinkled skin trawl the open plains, their numbers so great that few predators can challenge them. Fortunately, this herd does not interrupt the sample-taking process, but in future it may be prudent to scan the area with the craft's cameras more regularly.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedTropicalDesert = Small furry animals burrow into the sand to establish colossal colonies, creating vast underground networks of tunnels. A kind of bioluminescent fungus-like organism grows amidst the tunnels, which they have learned to cultivate and eat. Above ground, great herds of long-legged, tall herbivores browse from the highest trees, and silently communicate with stripes that can flash with bright light.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedNeedleleafForests = Kerbal-sized invertebrates blend into the snow, their exoskeletons as pale white as their surroundings. One jumps out at the craft as the sample drill extends, but stops before it touches it, seemingly sensing little warmth from its rigid exterior and deciding it would make a poor lunch.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedTundra = Efil's tundra is barren, but far from lifeless. Some enormous migratory herbivores can be seen here, coated with thick hair despite their invertebrate nature. With their long, flexible legs, they can stand upright to nearly triple their height and reach all but the very tallest of trees.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedColdDesert = The arctic deserts have precious few larger animals, but the soil below is teeming with activity. Astonishingly tiny furry creatures, the size of insects, scurry through the snow, digging tunnels and finding hardy plants with nutritious roots to harvest.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Efil_SrfLandedMountains = Sadly, there is not much to see at this altitude. The soil is mostly lifeless at Efil's highest peaks, however, great spear-beaked creatures with enormous wings can still be seen roosting on the cliffs. During the planetary night, when Efil passes through Anehta's shadow, these animals take to the skies to catch sea creatures and bring them all the way back here to feed to their hungry young.
	
		// Eulb
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Eulb_SrfLanded = Eulb's magnetic field is pretty weak, but it's not hard to detect with the instrument from the surface. Also, there are several smaller, stronger localized fields nearby.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Eulb_InSpace = Eulb's weak magnetic field generates fascinating distortions in Anehta's magnetic field as it orbits the giant planet.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Eulb_InSpaceLowGeneric = Now, why is it blue? Have we addressed that? Is somebody working on that? Get- Get somebody working on that.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Eulb_InSpaceLowCratersSmall = This is giving me "deja blue"... Get it?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Eulb_InSpaceLowCratersBig = Eulb's largest craters are sometimes difficult to tell from the maria. They almost seem to have been weathered, but the only force that could do that would be micrometeorite impacts. Just how old IS Eulb?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Eulb_InSpaceLowDoubleCrater = Oh, now there's an interesting feature. This seems to be two nested impact craters- one larger, and one smaller. The innermost crater appears to be the younger of the two.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Eulb_InSpaceHigh = A blue moon... Welp. Jeb, it's time to break out the chicken suit.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Eulb_InSpaceLow = Spectroscopic scans conducted of Eulb's surface show strong IR absorption nearly everywhere on the moon's surface. This implicates blue corundum, commonly known as sapphire, as the culprit of its striking blue color.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Eulb_InSpaceHigh = An extremely tenuous atmosphere clings to Eulb's surface. It's much too thin to be detected with a barometer.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Eulb_InSpaceLow = Multiple radio surveillance passes turn up nothing of interest on Eulb.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Eulb_SrfLanded = The scan reveals no significant quantities of subsurface hydrogen on Eulb.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Eulb_SrfLandedPoles = Low levels of hydrogen here may be explained by scattered water ice deposits.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Eulb_SrfLandedPolarCrater = A fairly strong hydrogen signal is detected here, probably because much of the polar crater's area rests in permanent shadow.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Eulb_SrfLanded = Chemical analysis of Eulb's surface shows that it is comparatively poor in silicates, and extremely rich in both aluminum and oxygen. This points to blue corundum as the reason for its blue coloration, a material commonly known as sapphire.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Eulb_InSpace = Eulb's weak magnetic field does little to deflect the solar wind, but Anehta is doing a lot of the work for it anyway.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Eulb_InSpaceLow = A weak microwave signal is detected, but only when the antennae are pointed at the poles.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Eulb_InSpaceHigh = Eulb has quite a high albedo. Its bright surface reflects a lot of light in all recorded wavelengths except red and infrared.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Eulb_SrfLanded = Seismic scans are absorbed fairly well by the powdery blue regolith. You may get better results in a more solid location, like a large crater.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Eulb_SrfLandedCratersBig = Analysis of Eulb's interior reveals a dense composition, probably just as rich in aluminum oxides like corundum as the surface is. 
		
		// Elad
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmMagScan_Elad_SrfLanded = Magnetic field lines run in strange directions, seeming to point to a pair of magnetic poles that are tilted about 40 degrees off the axis of rotation.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Elad_InSpaceLow = Elad has a powerful magnetic field, comparable in strength to Kerbin.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_bothMagScan_Elad_InSpaceHigh = Magnetic interference from Anehta is somewhat quieter at this distance, and Elad seems to be generating a considerable magnetic field of its own.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Elad_InSpace = Elad strongly distorts Anehta's magnetic field with a powerful field of its own, the pair proving quite effective at deflecting solar wind together.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowGeneric = Elad's wastelands are a stark contrast to Efil's lush hills and crystalline seas, and a grim reminder of the fragility of life in the universe.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowCraters = The sparse nature of these craters compared to other objects, like the nearby Eulb, lend a lot of weight to the notion that Elad had a thick atmosphere rather recently.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowCraterLarge = Elad has several large craters like this scattered about, all of which seem to be fairly young features.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowCraterGiant = This huge crater is large enough that it could have been what was responsible for the loss of Elad's atmosphere, but it's impossible to be sure.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowGrandCanyon = This canyon is so steep and so deep, it must have once been an oceanic trench.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowValleys = Elad is covered in deep canyons and rift valleys that constitute clear evidence of active plate tectonics in its past.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceLowGrandCliff = Whoa. Now THAT is a cliff. Intense plate tectonics must be responsible for a ridge that huge.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_Elad_InSpaceHigh = RnD says these odd surface features can only really be explained by Elad having recently lost a thick atmosphere and possibly oceans too. It looks so desolate... Could that really be true?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Elad_InSpaceLow = Spectral analysis shows the surface has a similar composition to Kerbin; rich in silicates and metals.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Elad_InSpaceHigh = Thermal emissions reveal signs of internal heating on Elad, indicating current geological activity. 
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_Elad_InSpaceLow = If anything- or anyone- once lived on Elad, they've gone radio-silent now.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Elad_SrfLanded = There is a faint hydrogen signal here, but it is difficult to determine if it is faint due to distance or small concentrations.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Elad_SrfLandedLowlands = High levels of hydrogen are detected, but the signal is weak after traveling through a lot of rock. This may indicate the presence of liquid oceans deep underground!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedMidlandsHighlands = Elad's desolate surface appears to be chemically composed mostly of silicates, oxygen and aluminum. Like Kerbin, much of its surface is made of granite.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedLowlands = The ground here contains a large concentration of salt, heavily implying it was once the bottom of a sea or ocean of liquid water.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedGrandCanyon = The densely-packed surface in this canyon is extremely salty, lending a lot of weight to the hypothesis that it was once a deep-sea trench.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedGrandCliff = This massive cliff appears to contain several types of quartz.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedValleys = Elad's 'valleys' feature densely-packed salty terrain, implying that many, if not all of them, were once deep-sea trenches. It's possible Elad used to be an ocean world like Laythe.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedCratersCraterLarge = High concentrations of foreign metals and carbon compounds otherwise uncommon on Elad provide insight as to the composition of the impactor that produced this crater.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SrfLandedCraterGiant = This massive crater is rich in heavy metals and other compounds not normally found on Elad's surface, evidence suggesting the impactor was very dense and likely very heavy.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Elad_InSpaceLow = Slight traces of nitrogen are detected by the sensors in low orbit of Elad- perhaps the last remnants of its once-thick atmosphere.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_Elad_InSpaceHigh = Elad is doing a terrific job of deflecting the solar wind even at this altitude, but a number of charged particles are collected in such a way as to imply the existence of a Van Kerman radiation belt.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Elad_InSpaceLow = Orbiting above Elad's lowest regions reveals a consistently strong microwave signal, strongly implying the existence of subsurface oceans of liquid water. If Elad once had life, it's entirely possible it still lives down there!
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Elad_InSpaceHigh = Elad's bright surface has a pretty high albedo overall, helped by the moon's mysterious lack of an atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Elad_SrfLanded = Seismic reflections from deep within Elad confirm that its core is still fully molten, and its mantle is very active.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Elad_SrfLandedLowlands = The apparent composition of this region matches up closely with seabeds on Kerbin, and as a result it doesn't transmit seismic waves very well.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Elad_SrfLandedGrandCanyonValleys = This appears to be an ancient oceanic trench, judging by the composition and the signs of compression under tremendous pressure present in the ground here.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmseismicHammer_Elad_SrfLandedCraterGiant = Seismic scans of this massive crater clearly show large deposits of dense heavy metals, indicating the asteroid that produced this crater was probably metallic, and would've been massive enough to cut through even a thick atmosphere.
		
		// Wormhole(s)
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_rpwsScan_Wormholes_InSpace = Plasma from the solar wind on both ends of the wormhole appears to be interacting here, forming a complex solar wind environment unlike anything you've ever seen before.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_WH3141A_InSpace = You can almost see another planet on the other side. You see rings, a bright orange star, and... HOLY KRAKEN! Is that a big, black eye staring back at you?
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_scopeScan_WH3141B_InSpace = Jool's friendly green form is smeared across space, almost like an oil painting or something. You can see hints of Laythe, Vall and Tylo, too.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Wormholes_InSpace = The multispectral analysis proves... let's call it 'inconclusive'. Light from the wormhole is so heavily distorted that it makes it difficult to verify any readings you take as being accurate.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_WH3141A_InSpaceLow = Strange radio transmissions appear to originate from the object. As you monitor the feed, you could've sworn you heard someone saying "Hullo!" and "Fly safe". Thanks, mysterious space voice. We -will- fly safe!
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSIGINT_WH3141B_InSpaceLow = Monitoring radio activity emitting from the wormhole, you pick up the garbled echoes of transmissions from Kerbin.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_WH3141A_InSpace = The collectors pick up a surprising amount of solar wind at this location; this is probably coming from the other side of the wormhole.
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSolarParticles_WH3141B_InSpace = The solar wind here is a combination of Kerbol and Sunorc's winds; though readings from Sunorc are much more steady.
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Wormholes_InSpaceLow = Microwave radiation is emitting from the wormhole at a constant, but low rate. Is the wormhole itself responsible, or is something on the other side generating it?
		
		#LOC_KS_SciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Wormholes_InSpaceHigh = It's difficult to use this instrument when the slightest movement will bring any objects you can see through the wormhole out of focus. Perhaps you should just bite the bullet and head through?
