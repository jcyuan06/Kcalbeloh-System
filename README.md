# Kcalbeloh System

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KFlHVFt.png)
Kcalbeloh System is a planet pack adding an entirely new black hole system with 30 unique celestial bodies, including a super-massive black hole, 4 stars, 15 planets, and 10 moons and asteroids, each with its own unique set of challenges and features.

This planet mod provides a diverse range of environments for Kerbals to explore, such as a planet with surface torn apart by tidal force, binary gas giants with multiple moons, a planet tidally locked by its parent star, and a small moon with a twisted surface. Like the movie Interstellar, there are also a pair of wormholes available for Kerbals to jump between Kerbol system and Kcalbeloh system, adding another layer of exploration and excitement. 

If you're looking for an exciting and rewarding space adventure, Kcalbeloh System is an excellent addition to Kerbal Space Program, providing tens or even hundreds of hours of entertainment.

I really appreciate everyone who has followed this mod. Also thanks to everyone who has provided suggestions, bug reports, or any other forms of help. Also, if you have a cool idea and want to contribute to this project, feel free to let me know.

Get ready to blast off into the cosmos and embark on a thrilling journey through the Kcalbeloh System.

Happy launchings!

# Installation
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Jx0EVs1.png)
### System Requirements
   * OS: Windows Only
   * Memory: 8 GB RAM
   * Graphics: 1-2 GB VRAM

### Install Manually
1. **Install Kcalbeloh System**
   * Download (choose one):
      - [GitHub](https://github.com/jcyuan06/Kcalbeloh-System/releases) 
      - [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16RmGATxNw7G7VKPJ-uHRxg?pwd=plc0) (for Chinese players)
   * Delete the previous version of Kcalbeloh System completely if you have an older version installed.
   * Extract the zip file and put all the three folders in `/GameData` (`000_NiakoUtils`, `KcalbelohSystem` and `KopernicusExpansion`) to your `[KSP installation folder]/GameData/` folder.
2. **Install Dependencies**
   * [**Kopernicus**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200143-181-1122-kopernicus-stable-branch-last-updated-november-25th-2021/): for creating custom celestial bodies.
   * [**Singularity**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/193709-wip18x-112x-singularity-black-hole-shaders/#comment-3782330): for blackhole and wormhole shaders.   
   * [**KSPCommunityFixes**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204002-18-112-kspcommunityfixes-bugfixes-and-qol-tweaks/): for bug fixes.
3. **Install Visuals**  
The planet pack works fine without visual mods, but it will lose a large part of its aesthetic.
   * [**EVE Redux**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196411-19-112-eve-redux-performance-enhanced-eve-maintenance-v11151-07112021/): for clouds, dust storms, and auroras.
   * [**Scatterer**](https://github.com/jcyuan06/Kcalbeloh-System/blob/main): for realistic atmosphere, oceans, and sun flares.  
### After Installation (Please read!)
In KSP 1.12.x, the stock maneuver planning tool can cause severe lag/stutter in planet mods, so it's strongly recommended to disable it:
   * Press ESC in game and press the 'Settings' button. Then disable the maneuver tool in the setting menu, under KSP Community Fixes section. See below:

# Mod Settings
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SIjy14c.png)
Go to `Kerbal Space Program/GameData/KcalbelohSystem/` and open `Kcalbeloh System Settings.cfg`.

### Wormholes
`Wormholes = `: whether to have wormholes connecting stock solar system and Kcalbeloh system.  
   - `True`: (default) enable the wormholes.
   - `False`: disable the wormholes.

### Home Switch
`HomeSwitch = `: whether to move KSC to Kcalbeloh system. 
   - `False`: (default) keep KSC on Kerbin.
   - `Suluco`: move KSC and other launch sites and airfields to Suluco.
   - `Efil`: move KSC and other launch sites and airfields to Efil.
   - Home switch is NOT compatible with system-replacement planet mods (Beyond Home, GPP, RSS, etc).
   - Do **NOT** load any saved game after changing home switch setting.

### Distance
`DistanceFactor =`: moving Kcalbeoh System closer or further to stock system.  
   - `1`: (default) keep the default distance (271.8 Tm).

# FAQs
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cWaEZiR.png)
1. **Does it replace the Kerbol system or add a new system?**  
It adds a new system without any change to the Kerbol system. But it also offers home switch options which allow you to move KSC to habitable planets in Kcalbeloh system. For more information on home switch, [click here](https://github.com/jcyuan06/Kcalbeloh-System#home-switch).

2. **Is it based on the movie Interstellar?**  
Yes, but no. Although some ideas of the mod are inspired by Interstellar, the goal of the mod is not to facsimile the Gargantua system from Interstellar, but to create a unique star system.

3. **Is it compatible with other planet packs?**  
Yes, it is compatible with most planet packs but it still needs further testing. Let me know if you have any issues.

4. **Is it compatible with Real Solar System?**  
Yes, but you need to download a config file. See [here](https://github.com/jcyuan06/Kcalbeloh-System#how-to-make-it-compatible-with-realsolarsystem).

5. **Is it compatible with other visual mods?**  
Yes, it is compatible with most visual mods for stock system, such as Astronomer's Visual Pack, Spectra, and Stock Visual Enhancement.

6. **What is a wormhole? How can I use it?**  
A wormhole is a structure linking disparate points in spacetime. In KSP, a wormhole functions like a celestial body with its mass and SOI. To traverse the wormhole, you need to lower your periapsis below 30 km. After you reach the periapsis, you will jump to the other star system.
